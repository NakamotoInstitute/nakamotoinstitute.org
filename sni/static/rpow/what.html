<h3 align="center">RPOW - What Is This?</h3>
<p>
The RPOW system is, in practice, comprised of one RPOW server (with
the possibility of more servers in the future)
and a package of client software to let people create, manage and
exchange RPOWs.
</p><p>
<b>This system is the RPOW server.</b>
</p><p>
It receives POW (proof of work) and RPOW (reusable proof of work) tokens,
and returns new RPOW tokens in exchange.
The code runs on an IBM4758 secure cryptographic coprocessor,
used in a mode intended to make it impossible even for me,
as the owner and operator of the system,
to violate the security rules and to create RPOW tokens without
paying for them with appropriate POW tokens.
More importantly,
you, the potential user of the RPOW system,
can verify these properties.
See the <a href="theory.html">theory</a> and
<a href="security.html">security</a> pages for more details.
</p><p>
You can also
<a href="download.html">download</a>
client software,
which is released under an open source license,
to allow people to experiment with new applications
of the RPOW system.

<h4 align="center">Acknowledgements</h4>
<p>
This project would not have been possible without the aid and support
of several people,
although of course they are not to blame for any of my errors or
shortcomings in this effort.
The IBM Crypto team, along with those members of IBM Research who
maintain the Alphaworks 4758 tools,
have been helpful with answers to questions when I had a problem.
</p><p>
I particularly want to thank
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws/">Sean Smith</a>,
Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at
Dartmouth College.
Sean was one of the principle designers of the IBM 4758 and has
encouraged his students to pursue a number of projects which are
similar in flavor to RPOW.
I was very impressed by the scope and magnitude of these
projects, and this is what convinced me that it would be possible
to set up RPOW to provide services
to a worldwide community of untrusting users,
relying on the outbound authentication features of the IBM 4758.
Sean has been very helpful and supportive
in answering questions I had about the
security of the system.
</p><p>
Two authors whose work anticipated many of the concepts in RPOW are
<a href="http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/markus/">Markus Jakobsson</a>
and
<a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2029">Ari Juels</a>.
Particularly relevant is their 1999 paper,
<a href="http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/markus/papers/pow.pdf">Proofs
of Work and Bread Pudding Protocols</a>.
They propose to use special POW tokens
which create data that is directly useful
in a proposed ecash minting system,
allowing a form of re-use.
</p><p>
I am also interested in Markus' 1995
<a href="http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/markus/papers/rip.pdf">Ripping
Coins for a Fair Exchange</a>,
and I hope to borrow some concepts from that paper for RPOW.
Markus shows how an ecash system can be modified so that two parties
can jointly withdraw a coin,
such that neither one has the information necessary to deposit it.
This kind of protocol can ameliorate some potential problems
in RPOW token exchange,
such as people who bargain in bad faith and don't provide tokens
they have promised.

<h4 align="center">Legal</h4>
<p>
<font size="-3">
The RPOW system is an experimental technology demonstration and is exclusively for
personal, experimental, and non-commercial use.
This requirement is imposed by the license IBM Research provides for free use of
its development tools.
RPOW tokens have no monetary value and are to be used solely for their use as
evidence of the computer work which is necessary to create them.
