<h4>New Experimental Software</h4>
<p>
Here is where I will discuss some software experiments oriented towards
demonstrating possible applications of RPOW.
These are in a little rougher condition than the rest of the RPOW
package but developers may find them useful as samples and examples of
how RPOW can be used.
</p>
<h4>Python and Perl</h4>
<p>
RPOW can now be used with scripting languages such as
<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and
<a href="http://www.perl.com">Perl</a>.
This allows easy integration of RPOW into programs written in those
languages.
</p><p>
This integration is made possible with the help of
<a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>.
SWIG takes a C or C++ language library, such as RPOW, and allows it
to be called from a variety of scripting languages.
It supports not only Python and Perl, but also
Ruby, Java, PHP, Ocaml, Guile and others.
Only Perl and Python are explicitly supported in the RPOW Makefile,
but it would be straightforward to add support for the other languages.
</p><p>
To use these features,
<a href="http://www.swig.org/survey.html">download SWIG</a>,
build and install it.
Make sure that the installed <b>swig</b> program is on your command path.
You can now build the Python and Perl interfaces for RPOW, by using
the appropriate <b>make</b> commmand.
</p><p>
SWIG has been tested with RPOW on Mac OS X and Linux systems, and <b>make</b>
targets exist for these, for both Python and Perl:
<b>make&nbsp;swig_python_osx</b>, <b>make&nbsp;swig_perl_osx</b>,
<b>make&nbsp;swig_python_linux</b>, and <b>make&nbsp;swig_perl_linux</b>.
Give whichever command is appropriate for your machine architecture and the
language you want to support.
The RPOW Makefile includes explicit path names for the
development directories associated with these languages.
These path names may differ for different versions and installation
modes of the languages,
so it may be necessary to change them slightly for your system.
</p><p>
No documentation yet exists for the full exported API available from
the scripting languages.
The <b>rpow.i</b> file is the input to SWIG and describes all of the
functions that are available.
The examples below will illustrate some of the functionality.

<h4>RPOW enabled BitTorrent</h4>
<p>
One of the most revolutionary programs to come out of the P2P
(peer to peer) community is Bram Cohen's
<a href="http://bittorrent.com/">BitTorrent</a>.
BitTorrent has been spectacularly successful at using the power of
peer oriented networking to accelerate the download of large files.
By spreading around the network traffic load,
even files with many people trying to download them can be handled
efficiently, as each person uploads as well as downloads.
This sharing mechanism means that the traffic capacity of the network
scales as more users are added.
</p><p>
One of the cleverest features of BitTorrent is its "tit for tat" mechanism
to encourage people to participate as uploaders rather than as "leeching"
downloaders.
Each node chooses who it will upload to based on a simple algorithm that
gives greater priority to the nodes that are downloading generously to it.
This policy encourages people to upload so that they can improve their
download speeds.
It is decentralized and efficient at accomplishing its task, and this is
in large part why BitTorrent has been so successful
</p><p>
However, one area could seemingly use some improvement.
Once someone has finished downloading their data, they no longer have any
motivation to stay connected to the network and participate by uploading.
Doing so would benefit the network and the peers, but there is no direct
reward to the person who does so.
An informal system of etiquette has arisen among BitTorrent users, with
the rule being that you should leave your node connected until your upload
total is at least as big as your download total.
But there is no mechanism within BitTorrent to encourage people to follow
this rule.
</p><p>
RPOW tokens could provide such a mechanism.
Imagine a version of BitTorrent where nodes that have completed their
downloading (called "seeders") could earn RPOWs by continuing to upload.
And what could they do with those RPOWs?
Imagine further that this version of BitTorrent allowed nodes to send
RPOWs in order to get higher priority from other nodes which are downloading.
Just such an
<a href="btrp-0.1.tar.gz">experimental, RPOW-enhanced version of BitTorrent</a>
is now available for download.
</p><p>
This program, BTRP (BitTorrent RPOW), is a patched version of the command line
BitTorrent program, which is written in Python.
It uses the SWIG Python interface described above to add features to BitTorrent
to create, send, receive and exchange RPOWs.
RPOW enabled nodes recognize each other and exchange information about what
size RPOW they would like to receive per megabyte of uploaded traffic.
If the request is acceptable, each node will send an RPOW of the
appropriate size periodically.
As long as a node is up to date on the RPOWs it has sent, it is given
priority for uploads.
BitTorrent nodes have a limited number of upload slots, and up to date RPOW
nodes get priority for those slots.
</p><p>
This simple mechanism provides motivation for nodes to act as seeders and
continue to upload in order to earn RPOWs,
and rewards such nodes by allowing them to get priority on
subsequent downloads.
In this way nodes which act as seeders one day can be rewarded the
next day when they download an entirely different file from a different
group of peers.
</p><p>
For those who want to experiment with this capability, the download
is available from the link above.  The details
are in the
<b>README.RPOW</b> file.
BTRP will work compatibly with ordinary BT nodes when taking to them,
and the special RPOW features will only be enabled when talking to other
BTRP nodes.
So for test purposes you will need to set up a private BitTorrent download
network which is running multiple BTRP nodes in order to see the new
features in operation.
What you should see, if you have a mix of BTRP and ordinary BT nodes, is
that the BTRP nodes pay each other RPOWs and acquire priority for downloads
in that way.
</p><p>
Keep in mind that this is a simple experiment at this time.
I don't intend to deploy this on a large scale, and it's not even clear
that BitTorrent is the best target for an RPOW enhanced P2P file sharing
program.
Indeed, there are a number of issues which would have to be addressed
before such a deployment,
including questions of whether users could cheat and acquire RPOWs
without downloading data.
There could conceivably be negative effects on the efficiency of the BitTorrent
network if people who had earned RPOWs could get higher priority than
other users who were uploading freely,
thereby failing to reward uploading.
On the other hand, those uploaders would be
motivated to continue in order to acquire RPOWs.
The net effect is hard to predict.
</p><p>
These questions will all benefit from further study,
but the BTRP program will hopefully serve as an example of how RPOW can
be integrated into existing programs.
I hope to provide further examples in the future,
such as a version of
<a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">spamassassin</a>
enhanced to receive RPOWs in the
message header as an indication that mail is not spam.
