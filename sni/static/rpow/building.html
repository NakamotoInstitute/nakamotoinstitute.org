<h3 align="center">Building the Server</h3>
<br><br>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
There are two potential reasons why you might be interested in
building the RPOW server program.
The first is that you may want to run your own RPOW server.
You will need to acquire an IBM 4758-002 secure coprocessor card to do this,
because that is the only architecture where the RPOW server will run.
The second, and more common, purpose is to create a memory image file from the
source code published for the RPOW server,
which matches the memory image file distributed with the RPOW system.
By hashing that file and comparing with the hash reported by the
remote system,
you can convince yourself that the source code is a true and accurate
representation of the program running on the 4758 secure coprocessor.
</p><p>
The discussion here will be oriented towards this second goal,
of successfully reproducing the memory image which was loaded into the
4758.
If you do have a 4758 of your own and want to build RPOW to run on it,
the same steps will work for that purpose as well.
</p><p>
The build instructions are for building on a Linux system.
The RPOW memory image was built using Linux GCC.
It might be possible to run these tools on a Windows system,
using Cygwin to let you run GCC,
but there is no guarantee that this would work,
and that the memory image that resulted would be the same.
</p>
<h4>Acquiring the tools</h4>
<p>
In order to build an exact copy of the RPOW memory image (executable program)
loaded into the 4758,
it will be necessary to use exactly the same development tools.
A different version of the compiler, assembler, linker, or the IBM
post-processing tools could produce a different result.
Since it is necessary for the result to be 100% identical to that
which was built and downloaded into the 4758 server,
the same tools must be used.
</p><p>
The tools necessary are:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://mirrors.kernel.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-2.95.3/gcc-core-2.95.3.tar.gz">GCC
version 2.95.3</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://mirrors.kernel.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.10.1.tar.gz">GNU
binutils version 2.10.1</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/4758toolkit">IBM Alphaworks 4758 Coprocessor Toolkit</a>
</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, as of early 2005 the free Alphaworks toolkit has
been removed from the IBM web site.
For now, please contact me for information on finding alternative
sources for this resource.
</p><p>
There are two binary files, <b>lxscctk.tz</b> for Linux systems,
and <b>winscctk.zip</b> for Windows NT and 2000.
You need to download them both.
Although we will be building on Linux,
the Linux toolkit is missing two header files which are necessary
for the build.
They are present in the NT version.
Follow the instructions below to copy the missing header files from
the NT zip file.
</p><p>
The GNU tools are relatively old versions,
but the IBM tools will not work with newer ones.
There was a change in the linker output format around the time
of GCC 3.0,
and the IBM post-processing steps will not work with files
produced by later GNU tools.
</p><p>
I will assume that you have a relatively modern Linux system with
a different version of GCC installed.
We will build a "cross-compiler" version of GCC which will reside
in its own directory
and be used only to build the RPOW memory image.
It will not affect or harm your distribution's version of GCC in any way.
</p><p>
Note that the link for GCC above is just for the "core" version;
there is no need for the entire toolkit just for this application.
RPOW is written in C and only that language is needed.
</p>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>
First, download the tools above, and unpack them into their own
directories.
(Note: for the <b>.zip</b> file, use the <b>-a</b> command to
<b>unzip</b> so that
text files get line endings approrpriate for a Linux file system.)
I will assume that they are all unpacked into directories that
are children of a single root directory that will be used
throughout this process,
which I will call <b>WD</b> (for Working Directory).
Throughout this description I will refer to file names like
<b>WD/scctk</b>.
You should substitute for <b>WD</b> the name of your own directory where
you unpacked the tools.
</p><p>
Unpacking the tools should produce four subdirectories:
<ul>
<li>gcc-2.95.3</li>
<li>binutils-2.10.1</li>
<li>scctk</li>
<li>scctk-NT</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
The first two are the GNU tools; the third is the Linux version of
the coprocessor toolkit; and the fourth is the NT version of the
coprocessor toolkit.
IBM uses the letters <b>scc</b> to stand for Secure Cryptographic
Corprocessor in their naming conventions,
and I have followed that policy as well.
</p><p>
The next thing we will do is to build the cross compiler.  CD into
the <b>WD</b> and follow these steps (remember to replace
<b>WD</b> with your own working directory path):
</p>
<pre>
mkdir cross
mkdir build-binutils
mkdir build-gcc
export TARGET=i386-linux-gnu
export PREFIX=WD/cross
cd build-binutils
../binutils-2.10.1/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=$PREFIX --disable-nls
make all install
export PATH=$PATH:$PREFIX/bin:$PREFIX/$TARGET/bin
cd ../build-gcc
../gcc-2.95.3/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=$PREFIX --disable-nls \
	--enable-languages=c --without-headers --with-newlib
make all-gcc install-gcc
</pre>
<p>
These instructions assume you have an sh type shell like bash.
If you have a csh type shell,
you will need to replace the EXPORT commands with setenv, as in
<pre>
setenv TARGET i386-linux-gnu
</pre>
and similarly for the other environment variables.
</p><p>
This should create a GCC toolchain inside of <b>WD/cross/bin</b>.
The files have the prefix i386-linux-gnu, as in i386-linux-gnu-gcc.
</p><p>
The next step is to copy the missing header files from scctk-NT
to scctk:
<pre>
cp WD/scctk-NT/002/include/common/scc*oa.h WD/scctk/include/common
</pre>
This will copy two files: scc_oa.h and scc_mboa.h.
The scctk-NT directory will not be used further.
</p><p>
Finally, edit the PATH to include the IBM development tools:
<pre>
export PATH=$PATH:WD/scctk/bin/linux
</pre>
</p><p>
Those are all the preparatory steps necessary.
</p>
<h4>Building</h4>
<p>
Now we are ready to build the memory image.
There are several steps, but they are all automated by the Makefile
supplied with the RPOW source.
Some editing of the Makefile is necessary before we begin.
</p><p>
Download the RPOW source from the
<a href="download.html">download</a> page.
The 4758 server source is in the <b>scc</b> subdirectory.
Go to that subdirectory and edit the Makefile there as
follows:
</p><p>
Set the <b>SCCTK_FS_ROOT</b> variable to <b>WD/scctk</b>,
where again <b>WD</b> is the working directory where you downloaded
and built the tools.
</p><p>
Set the <b>CC</b> variable to <b>WD/cross/bin/i386-linux-gnu-gcc</b>.
</p><p>
Those are the only edits needed to the Makefile.
Now build the memory image file:
<pre>
make rpow.rod
</pre>
</p><p>
This should compile the source code to <b>.o</b> files,
link to produce <b>rpow.exe</b>,
then run the IBM tools to produce first <b>rpow.xld</b>
and then the memory image,
<b>rpow.rod</b>.
There is a final cleanup with a short perl script to reset
the creation date within the <b>rpow.rod</b> file to a
canonical date
so that it will match the version installed in the RPOW server.
</p><p>
The installed <b>rpow.rod</b> file is supplied in the
<b>installed</b> subdirectory.
Comparing the file you just built with that one should produce
no output, meaning that they are identical:
<pre>
cmp rpow.rod installed/rpow.rod
</pre>
</p><p>
If all went well, skip on to the
<a href="#verification">verification</a> section.
Otherwise proceed to troubleshooting:
</p>
<a name="troubleshooting">
<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>
The most common cause of trouble is that the IBM tools are
built for older Linux systems,
and some of the shared libraries are no longer present in those
versions on new systems.
Particularly the program <b>cpqxlt</b>, which turns the
<b>.exe</b> file produced by GCC into a <b>.xld</b> file,
uses some shared libraries.
I was able to fix this by putting a symbolic link into
/usr/lib for the old version of libstdc++, as follows:
<pre>
cd /usr/lib
ln -s libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2
</pre>
You may need to add a similar link on your Linux system
if this tool complains.
</p><p>
If you have problems building the GCC cross compiler and tool chain,
there are a number of resources on the web.
The <a href="http://www.sthoward.com/CrossGCC/FAQ-4.html">CrossGCC
FAQ</a> is a good place to start.
</p><p>
In case the build succeeds but the <b>rpow.rod</b> file doesn't match the one
in the <b>installed</b> directory,
that directory also contains the other object files which are created
in the build process.
Comparing the <b>.o</b>, <b>rpow.exe</b>, and <b>rpow.xld</b> files with
those in the <b>installed</b> directory may give a hint as to what is
going wrong.
Keep in mind that object files typically include headers based on the
current date,
so it is not expected that these files will compare byte-for-byte identically.
One possible strategy is to use <b>hexdump</b> to convert a file to hex
format,
then to compare the files in that form.
This may help to distinguish insiginificant differences in the headers from
more meaningful differences in the compiled code.

<h4>Verification</h4>
<p>
Congratulations!
If you've gotten this far then you've successfully built the
RPOW source code into an <b>rpow.rod</b> file that matches the
one installed in the running RPOW server.
Verification of this fact involves two more steps:
</p><p>
First, run <b>sha1sum</b> on the <b>rpow.rod</b> file you just produced,
and note the hash it reports.
Second, examine the source code of the RPOW client software, the
<b>connio.c</b> module,
and look at the variable <b>seg3okhash</b>.
This should match the value output by <b>sha1sum</b>.
Examining the client source code will show that it receives
a signed data structure from the IBM 4758
which includes the hash of the running memory,
and that it compares against this value in the <b>seg3okhash</b>
variable.
Only if they match will the client accept the rest of the data and save
it as a valid key for communicating with.
</p><p>
Together, these steps imply that the source code supplied for the
RPOW server
produces an executable file whose hash matches that reported by
the running RPOW server system.
This report is signed by a key which is validated ultimately by IBM's
root signing key,
as described on the
<a href="security.html">security</a> page.
Only a valid IBM 4758 can make such a certification,
showing that this is in fact the code which is running on the RPOW server.
</p><p>
By further examining the RPOW server source code in the <b>scc</b>
subdirectory,
it is possible to verify that there are no back doors or loopholes
and that the system will behave honestly in its simple task of issuing
RPOW tokens.
This verification is the foundation for the security of the RPOW system.
