<br><br>
<h4>Components</h4>
<p>
There are three parts to the RPOW system:
client, host and server.
The source tarball available here includes all three.
Each part is of different utility for different readers.
</p><p>
The client code is most generally useful.
It builds a library which communicates with the RPOW server
and maintains a local file of available RPOW tokens.
There is also a command-line front end program which is intended
as a demo of how to use the library.
The code is released with an open source license and I encourage
readers to add other front ends, such as a GUI, to make the
system more functional and useful.
</p><p>
The server code is the core of the security of the RPOW system.
The unique claim of RPOW is that anyone can build an exact copy
of the program running on the RPOW server using this code,
and remotely verify that this is in fact the software they are
communicating with.
See the page on
<a href="building.html">Building the Server</a> for
extensive instructions on building the RPOW server memory image.
</p><p>
The host code is of less general interest.
This is the component that runs on the server where the RPOW
secure coprocessor card is installed.
Its main function is to listen for net connections and pass them
to the card, returning the results.
It also supports housekeeping functions for initialization, key rollover,
etc.
The host code will mostly be of interest to those who are thinking of
acquiring an IBM 4758 card and running their own RPOW server.
I will be happy to assist anyone who wants to undertake such a project.
</p>
<h4>Source code</h4>
<p>
Here is the tarball with the source code for the RPOW project:
</p><p>
<a href="https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/RPOW/releases/tag/v1.2.0">rpow-1.2.0.tar.gz</a>
</p><p>
<pre>
sha1sum: c16fbf594e64272879ade6892f00a743f6e05869  rpow-1.2.0.tar.gz
</pre>
</p>
<h4>Building the client</h4>
<p>
Building the client requires two libraries.
One is <b>hashcash</b>, available from
<a href="http://www.hashcash.org">www.hashcash.org</a>.
You need version 1.16 or later.
However, there is a bug in version 1.16 which causes occasional errors
on generating large hashcash tokens.
Until this is fixed, I am making available a patched version as
<a href="hashcash-1.16-patched.tgz">hashcash-1.16-patched.tgz</a>.
</p><p>
RPOW also depends on the
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> library being
available.
This comes installed on all modern Linux systems,
but on Windows you will have to download it and build it there.
</p><p>
When building hashcash, follow the instructions in the Makefile to
use OpenSSL for the token generation.
This is necessary for the hashcash library to be compatible with the
RPOW code.
</p><p>
On Linux systems, go into the <b>client</b> subdirectory and type
<b>make</b>.
This will create the executable <b>rpowcli</b>.
</p><p>
The RPOW client Makefile assumes that the hashcash source is downloaded
in a directory called <b>hashcash</b> which is a sibling of the main
<b>rpow</b> directory.
If you put your hashcash source elsewhere or call it something else
than <b>hashcash</b>, create a symbolic link as a sibling of <b>rpow</b>
called <b>hashcash</b> which points at your hashcash directory;
or alter the RPOW client Makefile to point at your hashcash source.
</p><p>
For Windows I recomend the use of the <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a>
package, which allows building native Windows executables.
You can build OpenSSL and hashcash using this package, and then
build <b>rpowcli</b> to link to these.
</p>
<h4>Binaries</h4>
<p>
This is the pre-built client command line
for Linux systems:
</p><p>
<a href="https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/RPOW/releases/tag/v1.2.0">rpowcli.gz</a>
</p><p>
This is the pre-built client command line for Windows systems:
</p><p>
<a href="https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/RPOW/releases/tag/v1.2.0">rpowcli.exe</a>
</p><p>
And this is the pre-built client command line for Mac OS X systems:
</p><p>
<a href="https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/RPOW/releases/tag/v1.2.0">rpowcli_osx.gz</a>
</p>
<h4>Running the Client</h4>
<p>
The provided RPOW client is a command line based program intended
to demonstrate the functionality of the system.
The program is split into a command line driver program and a library,
where the driver makes calls into the library to perform the needed
functions.
It is hoped that future development will result in more functional
and attractive front ends which use the same library interface.
</p><p>
<b>rpowcli</b> maintains several files which on Linux go by default
into a directory named <b>~/.rpow</b> (where <b>~</b> is the user's
home directory).
Users should create that directory before running the client.
Windows users should set an environment variable named <b>RPOW_PATH</b>
to be the directory where <b>rpowcli</b> will store its files.
</p><p>
In that directory the user should create a file called <b>config</b>
which will contain directives read by the RPOW client.
The only directive supported at present is <b>host</b>, which tells
where to look for the RPOW server.  It should be set as follows,
initially:
</p><p>
<pre>
host = rpow.net:4902
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the <b>~/.rpow/config</b> file (or corresponding one on Windows)
is set up with this entry, you are ready to try the client.
</p><p>
(Note that RPOW now provides support for using the
<a href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a> anonymizing system for access
to the RPOW server.
Users who want to take extra precautions to guard their privacy may
wish to set up Tor and enable RPOW to use it even before their first
access to the RPOW server.
This way, the RPOW server will never see the Internet address where the
requests are coming from.
For details, see the <a href="privacy.html#tor">Privacy</a> page.)
</p><p>
<b>rpowcli</b> takes a first argument which is a command name, followed
by arguments.  The various commands are as follows:
</p><p>
<!--suppress Annotator -->
    <!--suppress Annotator -->
        <!--suppress Annotator -->
        <!--suppress Annotator -<!--suppress Annotator -->
        ->
        <!--suppress Annotator -->
        <!--suppress Annotator -->
        <!--suppress Annotator -->
        <!--suppress Annotator -->
        <!--suppress Annotator -->
        <!--suppress Annotator -->
        <dl>
<p>
<dt>getkeys</dt>
<dd>
This should be the first command run.
It contacts the server identified in the <b>host</b> command in the
config file,
and downloads a certificate chain from that server which
includes the keys for communicating with the server and for signing
RPOWs.
It then passes this certificate chain through a stringent validation
test to be sure that it is in fact an RPOW server.
See the <a href="security.html">security</a> page for more details
of how the client validates the server.
If the server passes the tests, the client extracts the server keys
from the certificate chain and saves them in the <b>.rpow</b> directory.
It also prints the name of the hashcash "resource string" that should
be used with this particular RPOW server
in case you want to use the <b>hashcash</b> program to generate (or "mint")
values which will be acceptable by the RPOW server.
This is a long string composed of three hexadecimal numbers separated
by dashes, followed by ".rpow.net".
Note that <b>getkeys</b> is intended to be used only with a fresh install
and will wipe out any saved RPOW tokens in the <b>.rpow</b> directory.
</dd>
</p><p>
<dt>rekey</dt>
<dd>
This works the same as the <b>getkeys</b> command except that it retains
any saved RPOW tokens.
It can be given at any time if you want to make sure you have valid keys
for the server.
If the server has gone through a key rollover (described in the
<a href="world.html">World of RPOW</a> page),
clients must use the <b>rekey</b> command to acquire the new keys from the
server.
Their old tokens will still be good, for a period of time,
although they should be exchanged when convenient.
This command can also be used to print out the hashcash resource string
in case you want to use the <b>hashcash</b> program to create POW tokens
as described below.
</dd>
</p><p>
<dt>gen n</dt>
<dd>
This command generates an RPOW token worth n bits.
n must be in the range from 20 to 50.
This command is one of the main ways that you can receive RPOW tokens.
It uses the <a href="www.hashcash.org">hashcash</a> library to
generate a version 1 hashcash string worth n bits,
then exchanges that POW token at the RPOW server for an equal-value
RPOW token.
See the <a href="theory.html">theory page</a> for how POW and RPOW
tokens relate to each other.
The received RPOW token is stored in a file in the <b>.rpow</b> directory
named <b>rpows.dat</b>.
</dd>
</p><p>
<dt>gencontin</dt>
<dd>
This command runs continually and generates RPOW tokens until
it is interrupted.  It generates eight POW tokens and then exchanges
them at the server for an RPOW token.
The size of the tokens is adjusted dynamically so that it will take
from ten minutes to one hour to generate the eight tokens.
If you interrupt the program with control-C before it has generated
eight tokens,
they will not be exchanged and the last few minutes of calculation
will be lost.
That's not usually something to worry about;
this command is designed to be run overnight or when the computer is
not otherwise being used,
to help build up a supply of RPOWs.
</dd>
</p><p>
<dt>count</dt>
<dd>
Count how many RPOW tokens you have of different values in the
<b>rpows.dat</b>
file and display the counts.
</dd>
</p><p>
<dt>out n</dt>
<dd>
Find an output token worth n bits in the <b>rpows.dat</b> file
and output it to standard out,
in base64 (text) format.
Its intended use is for sending RPOWs to other people.
If you don't have a token of n bits, but you do have larger ones,
this command will perform exchanges at the server to break the
larger RPOWs into smaller sizes so that it can output the requested
size.
</dd>
</p><p>
<dt>in</dt>
<dd>
Read an RPOW or POW token from standard in, in text format,
and exchange it at the server
for a new RPOW token, saving that in a file.
This prints a message telling the value of the token received.
It is intended to be used to receive RPOW tokens from other people.
Exchanging the token at the server is the mechanism by which
the RPOW client verifies that the incoming token is legal: properly
formatted, and not used before.
This command can also be used to receive POW tokens created by the
<b>hashcash</b> program.  Run it as:
<pre>
hashcash -m -q -b bits -r rpow-resource | rpowcli in
</pre>
Get the correct <b>rpow-resource</b> from the string printed by the <b>rekey</b>
command.  This value will not change for the life of the server.
This command is equivalent to doing:
<pre>
rpowcli gen bits
</pre>
but the hashcash program may have optimizations which have not made it into
the RPOW client, so it might be faster.
</dd>
</p><p>
<dt>exchange inval ... 0 outval ...</dt>
<dd>
This exchanges RPOW tokens from your <b>rpows.dat</b> file
for new RPOWs of equal value.
List the values of the RPOW tokens you want to exchange,
one after another on the command line.
Then add a zero, and then list the values of the new RPOW tokens
you want to create.
The total value of the new RPOW tokens must equal the total value
of the old ones,
keeping in mind the rule that each RPOW token is worth twice the
previous one.
So you can, for example, exchange two RPOW tokens worth 20 for one
worth 21;
or exchange one worth 30 for three worth 28 and two worth 27.
There is a limit in exchange operations of no more than eight input
and/or output tokens per exchange.
If you have more tokens than that you will have to do multiple exchange
operations.
This command is meant to be used to split or combine RPOW tokens as
described in the <a href="theory.html">theory page</a>.
It can also be used to replace all of your saved RPOW tokens when there
has been a key rollover,
as described in <a href="world.html">World of RPOW</a>.
</p><p>
<dt>consolidate</dt>
<dd>
This combines smaller RPOW tokens from your <b>rpows.dat</b> file
into larger ones by doing exchanges at the server.
The result will be that you will only have one RPOW token of any
given size (since two of the same size can be combined to make
one of the next larger size),
up to the maximum size of 50.
You could have more than one size-50 RPOW token but that would take
a long time to generate (perhaps 50 year-2000-computer-years!).
Note that the <b>out</b> command will break up RPOWs into smaller
units if necessary.
</p><p>
<dt>status</dt>
<dd>
This receives and prints out an extensive block of information from the
server with information about the IBM 4758 and the software running on it.
Most of it is pretty technical and will not be of much interest unless
you know a lot about the 4758.
It does include some information about free memory on the system,
and it lists how many keys the server presently knows about and trusts.
(See the <a href="world.html">World of RPOW</a> page for information about
how servers come to trust multiple RPOW signing keys.)
</dd>
</p>
</dl>
<p>
Those are all of the <b>rpowcli</b> commands.  Here is a typical usage
example:
<pre>
$ rpowcli rekey
Retrieving certificate chain from server...
Validating certificate chain...
IBM root key signature on class key validated
Class key signature on device key validated
Device key signature on miniboot key validated
Miniboot key signature on OS key validated
OS key signature on application key validated
Cert chain validates OK, checking hashes...
Hash is acceptable!  Proceed...

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>
At this point
the RPOW client is relatively immature
and has not been built on many hosts.
It is not a particularly complicated program, though, so hopefully
it will be possible to easily fix up any portability problems.
Please notify the author if you need to make any changes to get it to
build on your host system.
</p><p>
If the server fails to respond, it may be down temporarily for maintenance,
although at this point I am to provide a high degree of availability for the
server.
It is also possible that the server may become overloaded if
many people try out the RPOW client at once.
I aim to acquire additional IBM 4758 boards to experiment with,
and I can make those available as RPOW servers if necessary.
