<h4>February 27, 2005: Version 1.2.0</h4>
<p>
RPOW has been upgraded to version 1.2.0.
The primary change is support for the
<a href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a>
anonymizing system.
This allows RPOW to be configured so that the Tor network
is used for all connections to the RPOW server,
keeping the server from seeing what Internet address the
connections are coming from.
Users who are particularly concerned about their privacy can
use RPOW in this mode.
For more details, see the <a href="privacy.html#tor">Privacy</a>
page.
</p><p>
For developers,
this version also restructures the client code to move the RPOW
storage functionality into the library,
which will make it easier to create GUIs and other software that
uses RPOWs.
</p>
<h4>February 16, 2005: New FAQ on SHA-1</h4>
<p>
A new entry has been added to the
<a href="faqs.html">FAQ</a> page discussing the
<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/sha1_broken.html">recently
announced attacks on the SHA-1 hash</a>.
RPOW does use SHA-1, but these attacks do not affect the security of the system.
</p>
<h4>February 7, 2005: Version 1.1.0</h4>
<p>
Version 1.1.0 of the RPOW client software is being released.
This uses the <a href="http://www.hashcash.org">hashcash</a> library,
taking advantage of
recent speedups in hashcash generation.
It also adds the <b>gencontin</b> and <b>consolidate</b> commands,
and enhances <b>out</b> to break up larger RPOWs if necessary.
These and other improvements are available from the
<a href="download.html">Download</a> page.
See also the new page on
<a href="experiments.html">experimental software</a> for some
sample applications of RPOW.
</p>
<h4>February 1, 2005: Presentation</h4>
<p>
Check out our new <a href="slides/slide001.html">presentation</a> on RPOW,
from <a href="http://www.codecon.org/2005/">CodeCon 2005</a>.
</p>
<h4>December 12, 2004: Disk Crash</h4>
<p>
Due to a web server disk crash, the RPOW web pages were temporarily off line
in late 2004.  The pages are now restored and the site is active again.
</p><p>
However, the RPOW server was unaffected and remains 100% operational.
RPOW generation and exchanges are still fully supported.
</p><p>
We apologize for the inconvenience!
