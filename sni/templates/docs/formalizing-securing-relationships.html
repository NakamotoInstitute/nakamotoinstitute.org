Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks 
</h2>	
By Nick Szabo

<!-- H2>Abstract</H2>
<i>
Smart contracts combine protocols with 
user interfaces to formalize and secure relationships
over computer networks.  Objectives and principles for the design of
these systems are derived from legal principles, economic theory, and
theories of reliable and secure protocols.
Similarities and differences between smart contracts
and traditional business procedures based on written contracts,
controls, and static forms are discussed.  By using cryptographic 
and other security 
mechanisms, we can secure many algorithmically specifiable 
relationships from breach by principals, and from eavesdropping 
or malicious interference by third parties, 
up to considerations of
time, user interface, and completeness of the algorithmic
specification.  This article discusses protocols with application
in important contracting areas, including credit,
content rights management, payment systems, and 
contracts with bearer.

History has seen successive revolutions in the costs of doing
global business.  First transportation, then manufacturing, 
and recently communications costs have fallen dramatically.
Yet there are still major barriers to doing business internationally.
The cost of doing business globally is increasingly
dominated by issues of jurisdiction, security, and trust:
the costs of developing, maintaining, and securing our relationships.
<p>
Despite the recent rise of global computer networks, our institutions
still take for granted that we live in a world of paper.  We formalize
our relationships with written contracts, written laws, and forms
designed for paper.  Our attitudes and laws regarding intellectual
property and privacy have assumed a world of paper which is
costly to copy.  Increasingly, we can no longer take these
deeply embedded, highly evolved paper institutions for granted.
Nor, since these institutions involve complex human relationships,
can we redesign them overnight.  We are entering a period where 
civilization must once again adapt to a radical new media.
</p><p>

Over the long stretch civilization, 
paper represents only one of many technologies used to mediate commercial
relationships.  The Inca used quipu -- accounts encoded on strings, a system
with interesting tamper-resistance properties.  Early
Middle Eastern civilizations used clay tokens for thousands
of years.  These combined the function of, and were a precursor to,
both cuneiform writing and coins.  Coins started out as lumps
of standardize metal and weight.  Since these were too expensive
to test during a normal business transaction, they came to be
stamped by reputable or powerful authorities.  Coins played
a major role in commerce for thousands of years, but that
era is now over.
</p><p>

Business is now dominated by paper and institutions of written
literacy.  Security measures have included chops, seals, and written
signatures.  Value has been transered via bills of exchange
(which evolved into checks), bearer certificates, and accounts
using the double-entry bookeeping system.  Most importantly,
we take for granted that contracts and law are written on
this static medium, to be interpreted and enforced by 
human authorities.
</p><p>

We are now entering an era of online communications and
software "literacy".  The "physics of cyberspace", studied
by computer scientists, are radically different from the properties of 
paper, to an even greater degree than paper was different from 
string, clay, and metal.   Not only written but also aural,
visual, and other sensory media can be combined.  Most
importantly, digital media are dynamic -- they not only
transmit information, but can also make some kinds of decisions.
Digital media can perform calculations, directly operate machinery,
and work through some kinds of reasoning much more efficiently than 
humans.
</p><p>
The movement from static to dynamic media promises to bring about
a fourth cost revolution in the related areas of jurisdiction,
trust, and security.  Impacts on business will be felt
in law, accounting, auditing, billing, collections, 
contracts, confidentiality, and so on: in short, the entire
nature of our business relationships will be altered in ways
only partially foreseeable.
</p><p>
The main traditional way to formalize a business relationship is the
contract, a set of promises agreed to in a "meeting of the
minds".  We naturally think of contracts as written, but oral agreements
are also considered contracts, and have been around since prehistory.
The contract is the basic building block of a market economy.  Over 
many centuries of cultural
evolution has emerged both the concept of contract and principles related
to it, encoded into common law.  Such evolved structures are often
prohibitively costly to rederive. If we started 
from scratch, using reason
and experience, it could take many centuries to redevelop sophisticated
ideas like contract law and property rights that make the modern market 
work.  But the digital revolution challenges us to develop new
institutions in a much shorter period of time.  By extracting
from our current laws, procedures, and theories those principles
which remain applicable in cyberspace, we can retain much of this 
deep tradition, and greatly shorten the time needed to develop
useful digital institutions.
</p><p>Computers make possible the running of algorithms heretofore prohibitively
costly, and networks the quicker transmission of larger and more 
sophisticated messages. Furthermore, computer scientists and cryptographers have recently
discovered many new and quite interesting algorithms. 
Combining these messages
and algorithms makes possible a wide variety of new protocols.  These
protocols, running on public networks such as the Internet, both challenge
and enable us to formalize and secure new kinds of relationships in this new 
environment, just as contract law, business forms, and accounting controls
have long formalized and secured business relationships in the 
paper-based world.
</p></a><p><a name="introduction">In electronic commerce so far, the design criteria important for automating contract execution have 
come from disparate fields like economics and cryptography,
with little cross-communication: little awareness of the technology on
the one hand, and little awareness of its best business uses other. 
These efforts are striving after common objectives, and converge on 
the concept of smart contracts [ </a><a href="#1">1</a> ].

</p><p>
Smart contracts reduce mental and computational 
transaction costs imposed by either principals, third parties, or their 
tools.  The contractual phases of search, negotiation, commitment,
performance, and adjudication constitute the realm of smart contracts.
This article covers all phases, with an emphasis on performance.  Smart 
contracts utilize protocols and user interfaces to facilitate all steps of 
the contracting process. This gives us new ways to formalize and secure 
digital relationships which are far more functional than their inanimate 
paper-based ancestors. 
</p><p>
<a name="Contracts Embedded in the World"></a></p><h2>Contracts Embedded in the World</h2><br>

<p>The basic idea behind smart contracts is that many kinds of contractual
clauses (such as collateral, bonding, delineation of property rights, etc.)
can be embedded in the hardware and software we deal with, in such a way
as to make breach of contract expensive (if desired, sometimes prohibitively
so) for the breacher. A canonical real-life example, which we might consider
to be the primitive ancestor of smart contracts, is the humble vending
machine. Within a limited amount of potential loss (the amount in the till
should be less than the cost of breaching the mechanism), the machine takes
in coins, and via a simple mechanism, which makes a freshman computer science problem
in design with finite automata, dispense change and product according
to the displayed price. The vending machine is a contract with bearer: anybody with
coins can participate in an exchange with the vendor. The lockbox and other 
security mechanisms protect the stored coins and contents
from attackers, sufficiently to allow profitable deployment of vending 
machines in a wide variety of areas.

</p><p>Smart contracts go beyond the vending machine in proposing to embed contracts
in all sorts of property that is valuable and controlled by digital means.
Smart contracts reference that property in a dynamic, often proactively 
enforced form, and provide much better observation and verification where proactive
measures must fall short.

</p><p>
As another example, consider a hypothetical digital security system
for automobiles. The smart contract design strategy suggests that we
successively refine security protocols to more fully embed in a property
the contractual terms which deal with it. These protocols would
give control of the cryptographic keys for operating the property to the 
person who rightfully owns that property, based on the terms of the contract.
In the most straightforward implementation, the car can be rendered 
inoperable unless the proper challenge-response protocol is completed with its rightful
owner, preventing theft. But if the car is being used to secure
credit, strong security implemented in this traditional way
would create a headache for the creditor - the repo man would no longer be able to
confiscate a deadbeat's car. To redress this problem, we can create a smart
lien protocol: if the owner fails to make payments, the smart contract 
invokes the lien protocol, which returns control 
of the car keys to the bank. This protocol might be much cheaper 
and more effective than a repo man.  A further reification would 
provably remove the lien when the loan has been paid off, as well as account for hardship and 
operational exceptions. For example, it would be rude to revoke 
operation of the car while it's doing 75 down the freeway.  
</p><p>
In this process of successive refinement
we've gone from a crude security system to a reified contract:
</p><pre>(1) A lock to selectively let in the owner and 
    exlude third parties;
(2) A back door to let in the creditor;
(3a) Creditor back door switched on only upon nonpayment 
     for a certain period of time; and
(3b) The final electronic payment permanently switches 
     off the back door.
</pre>
<p>
Mature security systems will be 
undertaking different behavior for different contracts. To continue
with our example, if the automobile contract were a lease, the final payment
would switch off leasee access; for purchase on credit, it would switch
off creditor access. A security system, by successive redesign, 
increasingly approaches the logic of the contract which governs the 
rights and obligations covering the object, information, or
computation being secured. Qualitatively different 
contractual terms, as well as technological differences in the property,
give rise to the need for different protocols.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="Contemporary Practice"></a>Contemporary Practice</h2>
<h4>Accounting Controls</h4>

Outside of the financial cryptography community, and long predating
it, there is a deep tradition of protocols used in the course of 
performing contracts. These protocols consist of a flow of forms ("data 
flow", canonically displayed in data flow diagrams), along with
checks and procedures called "controls". Controls serve many 
of the same functions as cryptographic protocols: integrity, authorization, 
and so on.  This article uses "control
protocols" or simply "controls" to refer to this combination of
data flow and controls.  
<p>
Control protocols, and the professions of auditing and accounting [ <a href="#2">2</a> ]
based on them, play a critical but ill-analyzed role in our economy.
Economists lump them, along with other costs of negotiating and
ensuring the performance of contracts,
under their catch-all rubric of "transaction costs".
But without controls, large corporations and the economies of scale
they create would not be possible. Controls allow a quarrelsome
species ill-suited to organizations larger than small tribes to work 
together on vast projects like manufacturing jumbo jets and running
hospitals. These control protocols are the result of many centuries
of business experience and have a long future ahead of them, but the
digital revolution will soon cause these paper-era techniques to be 
dramatically augmented by, and eventually integrate into,
smart contracts.
</p><p>

Controls enable auditing of contract performances, allowing
more precise inference of the behavior of an agent. Auditing
is costly, so it is undertaken by random sampling.
Economists study the substitutability between the probability
of verifying a breach and the magnitude of legal fines, where
physical enforcement is used. Conceivably, one could substitute
increasingly high penalties for increasingly rarer and less
expensive auditing.   However, this is not robust to real-world
conditions of imperfect information.
</p><p>
Since controls primarily address the implicit contracts between
employees and employer, there is little mapping from contract to
control.  A secondary function of controls to to monitor contracts 
with other organizations.  Here there is some mapping, but it is confounded
by the integration of the two functions in most controls.
Rather than based on contractual terms, controls are typically
based on managerial authorization.
</p><p>
Controls are typically based around amounts of money and
quantities of goods. A canonical control is double entry
bookkeeping, where two books are kept, and there must
be arithmetic reconciliation between the books.
To conceal an irregularity, necessary to omit from both sides, 
or to record entries offsetting the irregularity. Notice that
there is a problem distinguishing error from fraud. This
problem crops up in many areas in both auditing and smart contracts.

To illustrate, here are two common control techniques:
</p><p>
<i>Imprest</i>: this is a family of controls involving the receipt or 
disbursement of bearer certificates (usually notes and coins).
One example is the protocol used at most movie theaters.
Entry is segregated from payment by introducing tickets and 
establishing two employee roles, the ticket seller in a booth,
and the ticket stub salesman at the entrance. Periodically,
a bookkeeper reconciles the number of tickets with the total
paid. Discrepancy again indicates fraud or error.
</p><p>
<i>Customer audit</i>: Techniques to get the customer to generate 
initial documentation of a transaction. For example,
pricing goods at $.99 forces the employee to 
open the cash register to make change, generating a 
receipt.
</p><p>
A complete control protocol typically features the generation of 
initial documentation, segregation of duties, and 
arithmetic reconciliation of quantities of goods,
standard service events, and money.
</p><p>
Of these, the segregation of duties deserves special comment. 
</p><p>
In a large business, transactions are divided up so
that no single person can commit fraud. Segregation
of duties is an instance of the principle of required conspiracy. 
For example, the functions of warehouse/delivery,
sales, and receipt of payments are each performed by different parties,
with a policy that each party reports every transaction to a fourth function,
accounting. Any singular reported activity (e.g., delivery without receipt
of payment) indicates potential fraud (e.g., a delivery was made to a customer
and the payment pocketed instead of being put into the corporate treasury).
Segregation of duties is the auditor's favorite tool. Where it is absent
the auditor cries "foul", just as a good engineer would react
to a single point of failure. Many cryptographic systems have rightfully
gone down to commercial failure because they ground down to trust in a
single entity rather than segregating functions so as to require conspiracy.
</p>

<p>
There are least three significant differences between the scope 
and emphasis of smart contracts and controls.  Controls
are paper-era protocols designed around static forms,
place little emphasis on 
confidentiality, and are based on management authorizations 
rather than one-to-one relationships.

</p><p>
Smart contracts can be based on a wide variety of interactive 
protocols and user interfaces, and can be involved in a wide 
variety of kinds of contractual performance. Control protocols,
developed in the era of paper, are based on static forms passed 
as messages and processed in tables and spreadsheets. Controls 
focus on money and counts of standardized goods and service
events, easily recorded by numbers and manipulated by arithmetic, 
while mostly ignoring other kinds or aspects of contractual performance.  
Checksums on numbers, the basis of reconciliation, are crude and 
forgeable compared to cryptographic hashes. Electronic Data Interchange 
(EDI) keeps these static forms and maintains reliance on 
controls. It uses cryptographic hashes for nothing more 
sophisticated than integrity checks on individual messages.

</p><p>
Controls place little emphasis on confidentiality, at least in the 
modern accounting literature. The emphasis on 
confidentiality in paper-era protocols is lacking because 
violation of often implicit confidences, via replication of data, 
was much more difficult with paper. Furthermore, technologies for
protecting confidentiality while auditing were not feasible.
Businesses traditionally trusted accounting firms with
confidences, a trust that has eroded over the last century, 
and will erode still further as accounting firms start taking 
advantage of the vast amounts of inside and marketing information 
they are collecting from their customers' databases during audits.
Using paper-based protocols in a digital world, there are 
few effective controls against the auditors themselves.
Post-unforgeable transaction logs and multiparty secure computation,
discussed below, indicate the possibility of cryptographic
protocols to implement less relavatory but more 
effective auditing trails and controls; their use may be
able to ameliorate the growing problems with data mining
and breach of confidentiality.</p><p>
</p><p>Auditors place quite a bit of trust in management to authorize transactions
in a secure and productive manner. Objecting to this dual trust in 
management and distrust of employees inherent in the accounting 
tradition, there has been a trend in the last two decades 
towards a loosening of controls as a part of hierarchy flattening 
and empowerment of professional employees.
Unfortunately, loose controls have led to several recent scandals in the
banking and investment trade. The most recent view is that there must be a 
learned tradeoff between controls and empowerment. The smart
contract view is 
that we need smarter controls, originating at the ownership of the 
company, 
and entailing less asymmetry between management and other 
professional employees. This means converting many implicit 
employee contracts to more explicit smart contracts based on more 
direct relationships between owners (or at least their directors) 
and employees, and symmetric formalizations between employees.
</p><p>
Although most of these differences are biased against controls,
these traditional protocols have a long future ahead of them, simply
because they have a long past. They are highly evolved, hundreds
of years old (double-entry bookkeeping, for example, predates 
the Renaissance). Smart contracts
will incorporate many techniques and strategies from control
protocols, such as generation of an initial record, segregation
of duties, and reconciliation. 
It will not be long, however, 
before smart contracts start augmenting and transforming 
traditional business procedures, making a wide variety of new 
business structures possible and in the long run replacing traditional 
controls.
</p><p>


</p><h4>Electronic Data Interchange</h4>
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is the 
computer-to-computer 
communication of standardized business transactions between 
organizations, in a standard 
format that permits the receiver to perform the intended transaction.
It renders traditional static business forms in cyberspace, and maintains 
the dependence on traditional controls. Beyond
simple encryption and integrity checks, EDI does not take advantage
of algorithms and protocols to add security and "smarts" to 
business relationships. It enables more rapid execution of
traditional negotiation and performance monitoring
procedures.
<p>
EDI loses some security features provided by physical paper
(such as difficulty of 
copying) while not gaining advantages from the wide variety of 
protocols possible beyond simple message-passing of static forms.
This article examples a much richer set of protocols.
</p><p>
EDI contracts tend to be merely reiterations of existing terms and
conditions, with only some timing expectations changed for the electronic
environment. By redesigning our business relationships to take
advantage of a richer set of protocols, smart contracts can
take us far beyond the paper-based paradigm of shipping around 
forms in a secure manner.
</p><p>

The following classification, derived from Sokol [<a href="#3">3</a> ],
illustrates the variety of business forms
that have been rendered in electronic form:
</p><pre>Administrative
	Product code and price catalogs
	Catalog updates
	Forecasts and plans
	Deals and promotions
	Statements
Prepurchasing
	Requests for quote (&amp;response)
	Inventory inquiry/advice
Purchasing
	Purchase order &amp; acknowledgment
	Purchase order change &amp; acknowledgment of change
	Material release
	Point of sale/inventory on hand
Shipping and Receiving
	Shipment status inquiry &amp; response
	Advance shipment notification
	Bill of Lading
	Freight bill
Warehouse
	Inventory inquiry &amp; status
	Shipping notice
	Receipt confirmation
	Shipment order
	Shipment confirmation
Customs
	Declaration
	Release
Billing and Paying
	Invoice
	Payment remittance
	Credit and debit memos
	Receipts
</pre>


<h4>Automata as Authority</h4>
Focal (or Schelling) points are often designed and submitted into
negotiations by one side or another, both to bias 
the negotiations and to reduce their cost.
The fixed price at the supermarket (instead of haggling),
the prewritten contract the appliance salesman presents you, etc.
are examples of hard focal points.
They are simply agreed to 
right away; they serve as the end as well as the beginning of 
negotiations, because haggling over whether the nearest neighbor 
focal point is better is too expensive for both parties.  
<p>

There are many weak enforcement mechanisms which also 
serve a similar purpose, like the little arms in parking garages 
that prevent you from leaving without paying, the sawhorses
and tape around construction sites, most fences, etc.  
Civilization is filled with contracts embedded in the world.
</p><p>

More subtle examples include taxi meters, cash
register readouts, computer displays, and so on.  
As with hard focal points, the cost of haggling
can often be reduced by invoking technology as
authority. "I'm sorry, but that's what the computer says", 
argue clerks around the world. "I know I estimated $50
to get to Manhattan, but the meter reads $75", says the
taxi driver.
</p><p>

<a name="Dimensions of Contract Design"></a></p><h2>Dimensions of Contract Design</h2>
Economists stress two properties important to good contract
design: <i>observability</i> by principals and <i>verifiability</i>
by third parties such as auditors and adjudicators. From the
traditions behind contract law and the objectives of data 
security, we derive a third objective, <i>privity</i>.  
We flesh out the dimensions of contract design by disentangling
mental from computational transaction costs, classifying the
kinds of enforceability, characterizing the temporal phases
of contracting, and discussing the nature of tradeoffs between 
the three design objectives.




<h4>Mental and Computational Transaction Costs</h4>

The costs that smart contracts address are lumped by economists 
under the catch-all rubric of "transaction costs". We can
divide these into mental and computational transaction costs.
<p>
One major category of costs include the cost of anticipating, agreeing to, 
and clearly writing down the various eventualities. These are
largely mental transaction costs, although online research tools,
for example, may bring more information about eventualities.
</p><p>
Most contractual dispute involves an unforeseen or 
unspecified eventuality. 
We lack a good model for this.  Such a model would account for the 
computational costs of foreseeing these eventualities, some of which may
be uncomputable (and therefore of infinite cost). Where
eventualities remain unspecified, contracts remain incomplete.
</p><p>
Where counterparties lack focal points, they lack a meeting
of minds. Negotiation addresses this gap; the farther apart
the focal points (in terms of value), the more expensive the 
negotiations. There are a variety
of institutions of negotiation, which economists study under
the rubric of "mechanisms". These range from simple haggling
to sophisticated auctions and exchanges.

</p><h4>Contracting Phases</h4>
For the temporal phases of contracting we use
the following schema, classified according to the two-phase 
model used in economics:
<pre>	Ex-Ante
		Search
		Negotiation
		Commitment
	Ex-Post
		Performance
		Adjudication
</pre>

<p>Smart contracts often involve trusted third parties, exemplified by
an intermediary, who is involved in the performance, and an adjudicator,
who is invoked to resolve disputes arising out of performance (or lack
thereof).  
Intermediaries can operate during search, negotiation, commitment,
and/or performance. Hidden knowledge, or adverse selection, 
occurs ex-ante; hidden actions (moral hazards) occur ex-post.

</p><p>Here are some examples of contemporary electronic commerce
activities and the phases of contracting they deal with:
</p><pre>EDI			commitment, performance 
Contract drafting 	negotiations
Web surfing 		search
Payment 			performance
Online exchange		search, negotiation, commitment
"I agree" button		commitment 
</pre>

This article covers all phases, with a particular emphasis on
performance.
<h4>Observability,  Hidden Knowledge, and Hidden Actions </h4>
The first objective of smart contract design
is <i>observability</i>, the ability of the principals to
observe each others' performance of the contract, or to prove their 
performance
to other principals. The field of accounting is, roughly speaking, 
primarily
concerned with making contracts an organization is involved in more 
observable.
<p></p>
<p>Economists discuss "hidden knowledge", also known as "adverse
selection", which can occur due to lack of ability to observe
potential counterparties during the search and negotiation
phases.  Another major problem is "hidden actions", also known as
"moral hazard", which can occur due to the lack of observability and 
ability to drop out of contract during the performance
phase of a contract. 

</p><p>One important task of smart contracts, that has been largely overlooked
by traditional EDI, is critical to "the meeting of the minds"
that is at the heart of a contract: communicating the semantics of the
protocols to the parties involved.  There is ample opportunity in smart
contracts for "smart fine print": actions taken by the software
hidden from a party to the transaction.  

</p><p>
Here's a small example of smart fine print:
</p><pre>if (x == true) {
	printf("x is false");
}
</pre>
<p>
Without user interfaces smart contracts are largely invisible, like the 
electronics in newer car engines. This is both a blessing - counterparties
don't have to feel like they're dealing with user-hostile computers - and 
a curse - the "smart fine print" problem of hidden actions.

</p><p>To properly communicate transaction semantics, we need good visual metaphors
for the elements of the contract. These would hide the details of the protocol
without surrendering control over the knowledge and execution of contract
terms.  For example, encryption can be shown by putting the document in an 
envelope, and a digital signature by affixing a seal onto the document or 
envelope.  

</p><p>

</p><h4>Online Enforceability </h4>
<p>
Amid all the hype about "information warfare", lost in the noise is 
the fact
that it is impossible to commit an act of physical violence over the
Net. That includes not only all physical crimes of coercion, but
also arrest, incarceration, and other traditional methods of law
enforcement. Because of this fact, and the jurisdictional swamp
that is the multinational Internet, this article concentrates on means of
protecting against breach and third parties that do not rely
on law enforcement.
</p><p>
We can categorize the security measures against breach,
eavesdropping, and interference in the following manner:
</p><pre>Proactive
	- breaching actions rendered impossible
	- either side can drop out with minimal loss upon counterparty
	   breach
Reactive
	Deterrence
	- reputation
	- physical enforcement 
		third parties: tort law
	Damage Recovery
	- secured transaction
	- reputation
	- physical enforcement 
		principals: contract law
		third parties: tort law
</pre>
Currently, the most prevalent forms of security software are
not proactive cryptography, but reactive and panoptic methods like 
virus scanning software, filtering firewalls, traceroutes of attackers, 
etc. Once modern cryptographic protocols are more widely deployed,
the balance will likely shift towards preventative security.
<p>

</p><h4>Verifiability by Adjudicators</h4>
Reactive measures rely upon two areas: verifiability and penalties.
As discussed in the section on accounting controls, under ideal economic 
conditions, the statistical distribution of verification
failures is known, so that verification costs and penalties
are can be traded off neatly. But with imperfect information,
the jurisdictional swamp, 
and lack of collateral or other security, collection of
damage awards is even more severely limited than in contracts
confined to traditional geographic jurisdictions.
Reputation costs may be the only practical source of
penalties in many cases. For reactive measures to work, high 
verifiability is critical. 

<p>So our second objective is <i>verifiability</i>, the ability of a 
principal to prove to an adjudicator that a contract has been 
performed or breached,
or the ability of the adjudicator to find this out by other means. The 
disciplines of auditing and investigation roughly correspond with 
verification of contract performance. 

</p><p>

</p><h4>Privity: Protection from Third Parties</h4>

<p>Our third objective of smart contract design is <i>privity</i>, the 
principle
that knowledge and control over the contents and performance of a contract
should be distributed among parties only as much as is necessary for the
performance of that contract. This is a generalization of the common law
principle of contract privity, which states that third parties, other than
the designated adjudicators and intermediaries, should have no say in the
enforcement of a contract.  To maintain knowledge and control, performance 
must be encapsulated: protected from outside influences, especially 
sophisticated attacks. This is the idea behind both the legal doctrine of
privity, which restricts redress to the parties to a contract,
and the idea of property rights.  

</p><p>
Attacks against
privity are epitomized by third parties Eve the eavesdropper, a passive
observer of contents or performance, and malicious Mallet, who actively
interferes with performance or steals service. Under this model privacy
and confidentiality, or protecting the value of information about a contract,
its parties, and its performance from Eve, is subsumed under privity, as
are property rights.  The most common definitions of "security"
in the online world roughly correspond to the goal of privity.

</p><p>
Our generalized privity thus encompasses property rights as stable objects 
linked to particular contracts (and thereby the parties in privity to such 
contracts, the "owners").
Privity creates a clear boundary within which operate a
coherent set of rights, responsibilities, and the knowledge with which
to carry out those responsibilities and protect those rights. 
Clarified boundaries also allow accountability. Protection from
extraneous interference allows us to focus responsibility
for the consequences of contract-related activity onto the parties to the
contract.
</p><p>


</p><h4>Trading Off Contract Design Objectives</h4>

<p>
Privity says that 
we want to minimize vulnerability to third
parties. Verifiability and observability often require that we invoke them.
An intermediary must be trusted with some of the contents and/or performance
of the contract. An adjudicator must be trusted with some of the contents,
and some of the history of performance, and to resolve disputes and invoke
penalties fairly. In smart contract design we want to get the most out
of intermediaries and adjudicator, while minimizing exposure to them. One
common outcome is that confidentiality is violated only in case of dispute.
</p><p>Many kinds of
specific performance are often entrusted to intermediaries.
We must be able to trust the intermediary
(credit agency, anti-virus software vendor, certificate intermediary, digital
cash mint, etc.) with their particular claims (about creditworthiness,
dangerous byte patterns, identity, conservation of the money supply, etc.)
As Ronald Reagan remarked in a slightly different context, "trust but verify". To deserve our trust,
intermediaries must convince us that their claims are true. We need to be
able to "ping" their veracity, verifying that certain claimed
transactions in fact occurred. An entire profession exists in market economies
to perform this function: auditing. 
</p><p>
Ideally, observability and verifiability can also include the ability
to differentiate between intentional violations of the contract and good
faith errors, but this is difficult in practice, since the difference
is often largely one of subjective, unrevealed intent. </p>
<a name="Building Blocks of Smart Contract Protocols"></a><h2>Building Blocks of Smart Contract Protocols</h2>

<h4>Protocols</h4>
A <i>protocol</i> [ <a href="#9">9</a> ] in computer science is a sequence 
of messages between at least two computers. At a higher
level of abstraction, a protocol consists of algorithms communicating 
via messages. These programs act
as proxies, or agents, for human users, who communicate their 
preferences via users interfaces. We distinguish protocol
endpoints by names such as "Alice" and "Bob", but it should
be kept in mind that the end points are really computer processing
units, which may or may not be under the control of, or taking
actions contrary to the intent of, the human user. Human
users typically do not have full knowledge of the protocol in
question, but rather a metaphorical understanding obtained via
user interface, manuals, and so on. Unlike most real-world
contracts, protocols must be unambiguous and complete.
<p>

Protocols come in three basic types. I have modified the
terminology of Schneier [ <a href="#5">5</a> ] to match more closely to the
corresponding business terminology:

</p><pre>self-enforcing:  Alice &lt;--&gt; Bob,
mediated:   Alice &lt;--&gt; intermediary &lt;--&gt; Bob  
adjudicated:  (Alice &lt;--&gt; Bob) --&gt; [evidence] --&gt; adjudicator
</pre>

<p>
The corresponding smart contracts elaborate on "Alice" to
distinguish between the software (in two components, the
endpoint of protocol and the user interface), and Alice herself.
Cryptographic and other computer security mechanisms give us a kit of
tools and parts from which we can build protocols, which form the basis
of smart contracts.
</p><p>

</p><h4>The "Physics of Cyberspace"</h4>
The security properties of physical media are based on physical
properties we often take for granted, for example the unforgeability of 
an atom of gold.  The structural constraints ("physics") of cyberspace 
relevant to security are described by the mathematical theories studied 
by computer scientists, especially in the specialty called cryptography.
Here are the important "fundamental particles" of the cryptographic universe:

<pre>-- pseudorandom function families --&gt; 
	secret key encryption, hash, MAC, ...

-- trapdoor one-way functions --&gt; 
	public key encryption

-- pseudorandom bit generators --&gt; 
	generate keys, padding, cookies

-- information-theoretic/unconditional --&gt;
	one-time pads
</pre>
<p>
These "particles" are potent building blocks for engineering
secure protocols.  Imagine a material 
so tough, it is completely impervious to a supernova,
and so cheap you could use it to make walls, locks, safes, and 
envelopes to protect everyday items.   This is not just
a metaphor: cracking a 4,096 bit RSA key with best known algorithm 
really would require more electrical power for 
the computers than the power produced by a supernova.
These cryptographic primitives promise to be a main
driving force of the fourth cost revolution for global
business.

</p><h4>Cryptographic Protocols</h4>
A family of protocols, called <i>cryptographic protocols</i> because their first application was
computerized "secret writing", provide many of the basic building blocks that implement the improved 
tradeoffs between observability, verifiability, privity, and enforceability in smart contracts.
Contrary to the common wisdom, obscurity is often critical to security.
Cryptographic protocols are built around foci of obscurity called <i>keys</i>.
A key's immense unknown randomness allows the rest of the system to be
simple and public. The obscurity of a large random number, so vast that
a lucky guess is astronomically unlikely, is the foundation upon 
which cryptographic protocols, and smart contracts based on them,
are built. 
<p>Two significant cautions are in order when thinking about how
cryptographic protocols can be used in online relationships.
The first is that protocols usually provide security 
"up to" some assumption. This assumption
is a remaining weak point which a complete working system
must address in some reasonable manner. One common endpoint is
is assumptions about trusted third parties. Often the degree or 
function of the trust
is not well specified, and it is up to the real-world systems
analyst to characterize and ameliorate these exposures. 
The best mediated protocols only trust the intermediary or counterparty
with a well limited function.  
</p><p>
Even without trusted third parties, cryptographic protocols often
ground out in trust of the counterparty. For example, 
encryption of a message provides confidentiality up to 
the actions of parties with decrypting keys. Encryption does not
stop key holders from posting  plain text to Usenet.
We cannot just say that encryption provides "confidentiality"
and leave our concern for confidentiality at that.
</p><p>
The second caution is that much of the terminology used in the 
cryptographic literature
to name protocols ("signatures", "cash", etc.) is
misleading. Sometimes the terminology falls short on substantial
matters: a "digital signature", for example, is not biometric 
and is based on a key that can easily be copied if not protected
by another mechanism. Often cryptographic
protocols can be generalized to much wider purposes than implied
by the label. For example, "digital cash" is a very
general protocol which can implement a wide variety of
bearer certificates and conservation wrappers for distributed
objects.
</p><p>

<a name="Attacks against Smart Contracts"></a> </p><h4>Attacks against Smart Contracts </h4>

Protocols for smart contracts should be structured in such a way as to 
make their contracts <p></p>

<pre>(a) robust against naive vandalism, and 
(b) robust against sophisticated, incentive compatible (rational) attack
</pre>

<p>A vandal can be a strategy or sub-strategy of a game whose utility is
at least partially a function of one's own negative utility; or it can
be a mistake by a contracting party to the same effect. "Naive"
simply refers to both lack of forethought as to the consequences of an
attack ,
as well as the relatively low amount of resources expended to enable that
attack. Naive vandalism is common enough that it must be taken into consideration.
A third category, (c) sophisticated vandalism (where the vandals can and
are willing to sacrifice substantial resources), for example a military
attack by third parties, is of a special and difficult kind that doesn't
often arise in typical contracting, so that we can place it in a separate
category and ignore it here. The distinction between naive and sophisticated
strategies has been computationally formalized in <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/kolmogorov.html">algorithmic
information theory </a></p>
<p>
The expected loss
due to third party attack is called the exposure. The
cost of third parties to defeat the security mechanism
is the disruption cost. If the disruption cost is greater than
the expected benefit, we can expect an incentive compatible
attacker to disrupt the security.  


</p><h4>Public and Secret Key Cryptography</h4>
<p>One of the drivers of the trust cost revolution will likely
be the wide variety of new cryptographic protocols that have emerged in recent
years. The most traditional kind of cryptography is <i>secret key</i> cryptography,
in which Alice and Bob (our exemplar parties to a smart contract) use a
single shared, prearranged key to encrypt messages between them. A fundamental
problem we will see throughout these protocols is the need to keep keys
secret, and <i>public key</i> cryptography helps solve this. In this technique,
Alice generates two keys, called the private and public keys. She keeps
the private key secret and well protected, and publishes the public key.
When Bob wishes to send a message to Alice, he encrypts a message with
her public key, sends the encrypted message, and she decrypts the message
with her private key. The private key provides a "trapdoor" that
allows Alice to compute an easy inverse of the encryption function that
used the public key. The public key provides no clue as to what the private
key is, even though they are mathematically related. The <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/rsa.html">RSA</a>
algorithm is the most widely used method of public key cryptography. </p>

<h4>Public Authentication</h4>
<p>Public key cryptography also makes possible a wide variety of <i>digital
signatures</i>. These proves that a piece of data (hereafter referred to
as just an "object") was in active contact with the private key
corresponding to the signature: the object was actively "signed"
with that key. There are two steps to an authentication protocol:
signing and verification. These may occur synchronously, or, in many
public protocols, a signature may be verified at some distant time in the 
future.
</p><p>The digital signature probably should have been called a
"digital stamp" or "digital seal" since its function
resembles more those methods than an autograph. In particular, it is not
biometric like an autograph, although incorporation of a typed-in password
as part of the private key used to sign can sometimes substitute for an
autograph. In many Asian countries, a hand-carved wooden block, called
a "chop", is often used instead of autographs. Every chop is
unique, and because of the unique carving and wood grain cannot be copied.
A digital signature is similar to the chop, since every newly generated
key is unique, but it is trivial to copy the key if obtained from the holder.
A digital signature relies on the assumption that the holder will keep
the private key secret.</p>

<p>A <i>blind signature</i> publically authenticates privy information
(but can we use non-privy signatures blindly as well?)/
This is a digital signature and secret-key encryption
protocol that together have the mathematical property of commutativity,
so that they can be stripped in reverse of the order they were applied.
It's like stamping an unknown document through carbon paper (without
having to worry about smudging). The effect is that Bob "signs" 
an object, for which he can verify its general form, but cannot see its 
specific content. Typically the key
of the signature defines the meaning of the signed object, rather than
the contents of the object signed, so that Bob doesn't sign a blank check.
Blind signatures used in digital bearer certificates, where Bob is the clearing
agent, and in <a href="http://www.digicash.com/publish/bigbro.html">Chaumian
credentials</a> , where Bob is the credential issuer.</p>


<h4>Privy Authentication</h4>
The blind signature is one example of the many "magic ink signatures"
cryptographers have invented. Another class of these protocols are
used to limit the parties allowed to either verify the signature or to
learn the identity of the signer. The most privy are the zero-knowledge
proofs, where only the counterparty can authenticate the prover.
Designated confirmer signatures allow the signer to designate particular
counterparties as verifiers. For example, a business could give 
particular auditors, investigators, or adjudicators the authority to 
verify signed objects, while other third parties, such as competitors,
can learn nothing from the signature. Group signatures allow members to 
sign as an authentic member of a group, without revealing which 
member made the signature.


<h4>Protection of Keys </h4>

<p>So far, we've assumed parties like Alice and Bob are monolithic. But
in the world of smart contracts, they will use computer-based software
agents and smart cards to do their electronic bidding. Keys are not 
necessarily
tied to identities, and the task of doing such binding turns out to be
more difficult than at first glance. Once keys are bound, they need to
be well protected, but wide area network connections are notoriously 
vulnerable to hacking. </p>

<p>If we assume that the attacker has the ability to intercept and redirect
any messages in the network protocol, as is the case on wide area networks
such as the Internet, then we must also assume, for practical all commercial
operating systems, that they would also be able to invade client if not
merchant computers and find any keys lying on the disk. </p>

<p>There's no completely satisfactory solution to end point operations
security from network-based attacks, but here's a strategy for practically
defanging this problem for public-key based systems: </p>

<p>All public key operation can be performed inside an unreadable hardware
board or smart card on a machine with a very narrow serial-line 
connection (ie, it carries
only a simple single-use protocol with well-verified security) to a dedicated
firewall. This is economical for high traffic servers, 
but may be less practical for individual users. Besides better security,
it has the added advantage that hardware speeds up the public key computations.
</p>

<p>If Mallet's capability is to physically seize the machine, a weaker
form of key protection will suffice. The trick is to hold the keys in volatile
memory. This makes the PC proof from physical attacks - all that needed
to destroy the keys is to turn off the PC. If the key backups can be hidden
in a different, secure physical location, this allows the user of this
PC to encrypt large amounts of data both on the PC itself and on public
computer networks, without fear that physical attack against the PC will
compromise that data. The data is still vulnerable to a "rubber hose
attack" where the owner is coerced into revealing the hidden keys.

</p><h4>Capabilities</h4>
Object-oriented, or capability, security is a deep and promising area,
but beyond the scope of this article. Capabilities can potentially simplify
the design of many distributed security protocols. Instead of developing
a new or modified cryptographic protocol for each contracting problem,
capabilities may allow us to design a rich variety of distributed
security protocols over a common cryptographic framework.
<p>
For more information see
<a href="http://discuss.foresight.org/M1/nph-med.cgi/http://www.communities.com/company/papers/security/">Introduction to Capability Based Security</a>


</p><h4>Quora</h4>

<p>Quorum distribution of performance or control over
resources can be based on the 
<a href="http://bibd.unl.edu/~stinson/ssbib.html">secret sharing </a>of 
keys needed to perform or control a resource. These are also known as
threshold techniques. These are methods of splitting a key (and thus 
control over any object encrypted with that key) into N parts, of which 
only M are needed to recreate the key, but less than M of the parts 
provide no information about the key. Secret sharing is a potent tool 
for distributing control over objects between principals. </p>

<a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/markus/">Markus Jacobsson</a> 
has designed a quorum of mints for signing digital coins,
for example. Quorum establishes a "required conspiracy" of M
out of N to perform a function, providing an option for stronger protection
than the typical 2 out of N used in segregation of duties, and greater
confidence in the security underlying the segregation. <p></p>

<h4>Post-Unforgeable Transaction Logs</h4>

<p>Traditionally, auditors have contacted counterparties in order to verify
that a transaction actually took place (The "principle of required
conspiracy" at work again). With post-unforgeable logs, via <a href="http://www.surety.com/howfiles/detail3.html">a
hierarchical system of one-way hash functions</a>, a party can publically
commit to transactions as they are completed by publishing signed cumulative
hashes of the transaction stream. The confidentiality of the transaction
is fully maintained until an auditor "pings" the transaction
to determine its actual nature. The counterparty identity can remain confidential,
because it is not required to establish the other facts of the transaction.
The only attack is to forge transactions in real time, as the transaction
itself takes place, which in most practical cases will be unfeasible. Most
accounting fraud involves analyzing sets of completed transactions and
then forging them to make them compute to a desired counterfactual result.
</p>


<h4>Mutually Confidential Computation</h4>
Cryptographers have developed protocols which create virtual machines 
between two or more parties. 
<a href="http://harvest.transarc.com/afs/transarc.com/public/beaver/html/research/publications/biblio.html#mpp">Multiparty secure computation</a> 
allows any number of parties to share a computation, each learning
only what can be inferred from their own inputs and the output of the 
computation.

These virtual machines have the exciting 
property that each party's input is strongly confidential from the 
other parties. The program and the output are shared by the parties.  
So, for example, we could run a spreadsheet across the Internet on this 
virtual computer. We would agree on a set of formulas, set up the virtual
computer with these formulas, and each input our own private data. We 
could only learn only as much about the other participants' 
inputs as we could infer from our own inputs and the output. 
<p>
There are two major complications. The first is that this virtual computer
is very slow: one machine instruction per network message.  The second
is that some parties learn the results before others.  Several 
<a href="http://harvest.transarc.com/afs/transarc.com/public/beaver/html/research/publications/biblio.html#mpp">papers</a> 
have disussed
the fraction of parties one must trust in order to be assured of
learning the correct output. The mechanism must be constructed so that a 
sufficient number of parties have an incentive to pass
on the correct result, or reputation, side contracts, etc. used
to the same effect.
</p><p>
With these caveats, any algorithmic intermediary can, in principle, be
replaced by a trustworthy virtual computer. In practice, because
of the two complications, we usually construct more limited protocols 
out of more efficient elements.
</p><p>


<br> 
</p><h3>Trusted Third Party:</h3>

<br>
<h3>Mathematically Trustworthy Protocol:</h3>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/virtual.gif')}}" align="bottom">

<p>
Multiparty secure computer theory, by making possible privy virtual
intermediation, has major implications for all phases of 
contracting. This can be seen most clearly in the area of 
negotiations.
A "mechanism" in economics is an abstract model of an institution which 
communicates with its participants via messages, and whose rules can be 
specified algorithmically. These institutions can be auctions, exchanges, 
voting, and so on.  They typically implement some kind of negotiation
or decision making process.  
</p><p>
Economists assume a trusted intermediary operates the mechanism.
Here's a simple example of using this virtual computer for a mechanism.
Alice can submit a bid price, and Bob an
ask price, to their shared virtual computer which has one instruction, 
"A greater than B?". The computer then returns "true" if Alice's bid is 
greater than Bob's offer. A slightly more sophisticated computer may
then decide the settlement price according to a number of different
algorithms (Alice's bid, Bob's ask, split the difference, etc.)
This implements the mechanism "blind bargaining" with no trusted
intermediary.

</p><p>
In principle, since any computable problem can be solved on this virtual 
computer (they are "Turing complete"), any computable economic mechanism 
can be implemented without a trusted intermediary. In practice, these 
secure virtual computers run very slowly (one virtual machine 
instruction per network message), and the order in which participants 
learn results often matters. But the existence proof, that any 
economic mechanism can be run without a trusted intermediary, up to 
temporal issues, is very exciting. This means that, in principle,
any contract which can be negotiated through a trusted third party
(such as an auction or exchange) can be negotiated directly.
So, in some abstract sense, the only remaining "hard" problems
in smart contract negotiations are (a) problems considered hard even
with a trusted intermediary (for the standard economic reasons),
(b) nonsimultaneity problems in learning the decision, 
and (c) the task of algorithmically specifying the negotiating rules 
and output contract terms (This includes cases where an
intermediary adds knowledge unavailable to the participants,
such as a lawyer giving advice on how to draft a contract).
</p><p>

Applying this kind of analysis to the performance phase of 
contracts is less straightforward. For starters, economic
theories of the performance phase are not as well developed or
simple as the mechanism theory of negotiations. Indeed, most 
economic theory simply assumes that all contracts can be 
perfectly and costlessly enforced. Some of the "transaction cost" 
literature has started to move beyond this assumption, but there are 
few compelling results or consensus theories in the area of 
techniques and costs of contract enforcement.
</p><p>
Performance phase analysis with multiparty secure computer theory
would seem to apply only to those contracts which can 
be performed inside the virtual computer. But the use of 
post-unforgeable auditing logs, combined
with running auditing protocols inside the shared virtual computer,
allows a wide variety of performances outside the virtual computer
to at least be observed and verified by selected arbitrators, 
albeit not proactively self-enforced.  
</p><p>
The participants in this
mutually confidential auditing protocol
can verify that the books match the details of 
transactions stored in a previously committed transaction log, and 
that the numbers add up correctly.   
The participants can compute summary statistics on their confidentially
shared transaction logs, including cross-checking of the logs against 
counterparties to a transaction, without revealing those logs. 
They only learn what can be 
inferred from the statistics, can't see the details of the transactions.
Another intriguing possibility is that the virtual computer can keep 
state over long periods of time, allowing sophisticated forms of 
privy and self-enforcing secured credit.
</p><p>
With mutually confidential auditing we will be able to gain high
confidence in the factuality of counterparties' claims and reports without
revealing identifying and other detailed information from the transactions
underlying those reports. These provide the basis for solid reputation
systems, and other trusted third party systems, that maintain integrity
across time, communications, and summarization, and preserve confidentiality
for transaction participants. Knowing that mutually confidential auditing 
can be accomplished in principle may 
lead us to practical solutions. </p><p>

<a name="Contracts with Bearer"></a></p><h2>Contracts with Bearer</h2>

<h4>Bearer Certificates</h4>
<p>
Bearer certificates implement transferable rights on standardized contracts.
Each kind of contract (for example, each 
denomination of "coin" in digital cash) corresponds to a digital 
signature, just as each issue of Federal Reserve Notes or stock 
certificates corresponds to a particular plate.  
</p><p>
In the most straightforward bearer certificate protocol, the issuer 
and transfer agent (the same entity, for our purposes, though they 
can easily be unbundled) create a serial number (really a large
unguessable random number, rather than a sequence), and add it to a list
of issued certificates. The transfer agent clears a transfer
by checking the signature to identify and nature of the bearer 
contract and verify that it was made, then looking on that
contract's issued list to make sure the serial number is there,
then removing the serial number. Alternatively, the issuer can 
let the issuee make up the
serial number, then, when cleared, check the signature and put
the number on the list of cleared certificates. The signature provides
the assurance that the certificate is indeed the the particular
kind of contract with bearer, while the serial number assures that
the same instance of that contract is not cleared or redeemed more than
once. In these simple versions, the transfer agent can link the 
transferee to the transferor for all transfers. To implement the 
privacy characteristics of coins and physical bearer certificates, we 
need to add unlinkability features.

</p><h4>Unlinkable Transfers</h4>
Unlinkability can be provided by combining the second variation
above, a list of cleared certificates, with blind signatures and
a mixing effect. Enough instances of a standardized contract are
issued over a period of time to create a mix. Between the issuing and
clearing of a certificate, many other certificates with the
same signature will be cleared, making it highly improbable
that a particular clearing can be linked to a particular issue
via the signature. There is a tradeoff between the mixing
effect and the exposure to the theft of a "plate" for a particular
issue: the smaller the issue, the smaller the exposure but the
greater the linkability; a larger issue has both greater exposure
and greater confidentiality.

<p>Blind signatures can be used to make certificate transfers unlinkable
via serial number. Privacy from
the transfer agent can take the form of transferee-unlinkability, 
transferor-unlinkability,
or "double blinded" where both transferor and transferee are
unlinkable by the transfer agent or a collusion of a transfer
agent and counterparty. </p>

<p>Bearer certificates come
in an "online" variety, cleared during every transfer, and thus
both verifiable and observable, and an "offline" variety, which
can be transferred without being cleared, but is only verifiable when finally
cleared, by revealing any the clearing name of any intermediate holder who
transferred the object multiple times (a breach of contract). 

</p><p>This unlinkability is often called "anonymity", but the issue
of whether accounts are issued to real names or pseudonyms, and
whether transferor and transferee identify themselves to each
other, is orthogonal to unlinkability by the transfer agent
in the online model. In the off-line model, account identification
(or at least a highly reputable and/or secured pseudonym)
is required: passing  an offline certificate a second time reveals
this identity. Furthermore, communications channels can allow Eve to 
link transferor and transferee, unless they take the precaution of
using an anonymous remailer. Online clearing does make lack of 
identification a reasonable option for many kinds of transactions, although
common credit and warrantee situations often benefit from or even 
require identification.

</p><p>When confronting an attempted clearing of a cleared serial
number, we face an error-or-fraud dilemma similar to the one
we encountered above in double entry bookkeeping. The ecash(tm)
protocol from DigiCash actually takes advantage of this ambiguity,
second-transferring certificates on purpose to recover from a 
network failure. When certificates are lost over the net it is not clear 
to the transferor whether they have been received and cleared by the 
transferee or not.   Second-transferring directly with the transfer agent 
resolves the ambiguity.  This only works with the online protocol.  
The issue of distinguishing error from fraud is urgent in the offline 
protocol, but there is as yet no highly satisfactory solution.
This problem is often intractable due to the subjectivity of intent.
</p><h4>Conserved Objects</h4>
<p>Issuance and cleared transfer of references to a distributed object
conserves the usage of that object. This object becomes "scarce" in economic
terms, just as use of physical objects is finite. Conserved 
objects provide the basis for a software economics that more
closely resembles economics of scarce physical objects.
Conserved objects can be used to selectively exclude not only
scarce physical resources (such as CPU time, network bandwidth
and response time, etc.), but also fruits of intellectual
labor - as long as one is willing to pay the price to interact
with that information over the network rather than locally
(cf. content rights management). Conservation immunizes objects
and the resources they encapsulate to denial of service
attacks.
Bearer certificate protocols can be used to transfer references to a particular instance
or set of instances of an object, just as they
can be used to transfer other kinds of standardized rights.

</p><h4>Digital Cash</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.digicash.com/ecash/about.html">Digital cash </a>is
the premier example of a digital bearer certificate.  The issue and
transfer agent is called a "mint".
Bearer certificate protocols enable online payment while
honoring the characteristics desired of bearer notes, especially 
unforgeability (via the clearing mechanism) and transfer 
confidentiality (via mixing and blinding).</p>
<p>To implement a full transaction of payment for services, we often 
need need 
more than just the digital cash protocol; we need a protocol that guarantees
that service will be rendered if payment is made, and vice versa. Current
commercial systems use a wide variety of techniques to accomplish this,
such as certified mail, face to face exchange, reliance on credit history
and collection agencies to extend credit, etc. Potential smart
contract protocols in this area are discussed under Credit.</p>

<a name="Content Rights Management"></a><h2>Content Rights Management</h2>
Content protection contracts are valuable in that they incentive
publishers to allow users to view content directly, rather than indirectly 
and partially via queries to remote servers. Content protection of 
software distributed online would allow it to be run locally rather than 
remotely, while enforcing the contract rights and copyrights of the 
publisher against the user. This local usage billing of software often 
goes under the rubric of "superdistribution" [ <a href="#11">11</a> ].

<h4> Watermarks </h4>
<p>
Watermark schemes work by altering less significant bits of
content - usually
a picture; sound works less well and text is difficult. These 
altered bits typically contain the identities of the publisher and 
viewer, and
perhaps other information related to the contract. The idea
is that, when investigators scan released content, the watermark
will finger the breacher of the contract (or violator of copyright
law). 
</p><p>

Watermark investigation can be assisted by a quite inexpensive
technique, Web spiders. These spiders look for redistributed 
watermarked material on the Web. The customer originating the
copy can then be fingered.
</p><p>

One attack against watermarks is to overwrite likely watermark 
bits with other patterns legitimate to viewing software. The
entanglement of watermark bits with bits important to the picture can be 
made rather obscure, but not strongly so by the standards of cryptography.
Another attack is to steal content from a customer and distribute 
it as is. The watermark will finger the victim, rather than the thief.
</p><p>

All watermark schemes can be defeated with sufficient effort.  
These schemes can then be distributed as software worldwide.
Once the initial effort is put into breaking a scheme, the marginal
cost of breaking it is minimal. Furthermore, once the watermark
is removed, the content can be distributed and even published [ <a href="#12">12</a> ]
with secure anonymity.
</p><p>
In sum, watermark schemes can add significant risk to the copying
of of low value or ephemeral information. This will be sufficient
for many kinds of content, such as news or product updates.  
It won't stop, for long, the redistribution of high-value content.   
Since watermarks require traceable identification, they reduce 
customer privacy and require the inconvenience of registration 
and authentication, adding to the transaction costs of content
purchase.
</p><p>

</p><h4> Controlled CPUs </h4>
Contrary to the hype, there is no strong content protection 
software. Watermarks are as close as we've come, and they
fall far short of the standards of computer security. Large 
sums have gone into attempts to develop such
technology, resulting in hundreds of patents but no substantial
results.
<p>
As a result, some publishers have begun putting their research dollars
into a radical alternative, innocuously dubbed the "secure CPU" (SPU)
[ <a href="#13">13</a> ].
This is a CPU that is "secure" against the owner of the computer!
To enforce copyright or content contracts, the SPU monitors all 
content-related activity. Some marketing literature even lists,
alongside the traditional copyright, a new "right" of publishers 
to monitor the usage of their content. Remarkably enough, these
panoptic non-personal computers are the focus of major R&amp;D efforts.
</p><p>
The radical SPU projects demonstrate both the high value of content 
contracts to publishers and the high price we have to pay to maintain 
the paper-era intellectual property model online. Strong content
protection would be valuable in going beyond indirect and partial
viewing of content on servers, to viewing content directly and locally.
The price is the loss of control over our own computers, and loss
of privacy over our activities on those computers.

</p><p>
The online content market is squeezed from above and below. From
above, by the ease of redistributing high-value content. From
below, by the mental transaction costs of charging for low value
content - costs to which the requirements of registration and
traceable identification add substantially. The size of the
market in between is an open question. "Information wants to be
free", but authors and publishers want to be paid for it.
The current content market for more difficult to copy media, such 
as books, films, CD-ROM, and so forth is large, in the hundreds of
billions of dollars per year. But on the Internet, free content
dominates. Distributing ephemeral content in the form of service 
subscriptions is in most cases a more viable way to go.
It remains to be seen how large the Internet content
market will become, and to what extent customers will tolerate
impositions on privacy and control of their computers in order
to obtain legal content.</p><p>
<a name="Reputation Systems"></a>
</p><h2>Reputation Systems</h2>
<p>
Reputation can be viewed as the amount of trust an agent has created for 
himself [ <a href="#14">14</a> ]. Reputation systems ultimately need to be based on fact 
rather than mere opinion or faith to be effective. For example, if we are 
to have a good credit rating system, we need to be confident that the 
credit record assembled by the agency is sufficiently accurate. Reputation 
information is typical gathered and distributed by intermediaries trusted 
to perform this task.  

Reputation can take the form of a public database (such as credit
rating services) or credentials issued by the tracking agency
and carried by the user.  A bearer doesn't want to show his
negative credentials, so credentials are often only positive.
But we want to protect ourselves against negative behavior sources
well as search out positive sources.

</p><p>Tags that bundle the results of a wide variety of transactions - global
names, or universal IDs, or "True Names" - may provide
the most incentive for parties to carry their negative credentials. Most
people have accumulated enough positive reputation is some areas that it
is well-nigh impossible for them to start over their entire lives as newcomers.
</p>

<p>Robin Hanson [ <a href="#15">15</a> ]
 has observed that in a world of global names, the use of a
local name may signal the hiding of negative credentials, so that the use
of global names is in equilibrium. A further problem with local names is
that our relationships are often not neatly compartmentalizable into standard
service types, and even where they are we might like to expand them into
new areas. On the other hand, local names are essential for privacy.
I suggest that we will want to reveal progressively
more local names to our counterparties as our relationships with them become
closer and more co-exposed. </p>

<p>While the global name equilibrium may hold for many of our relationships,
there may be plenty of areas where the
privity benefits of localizing names outweigh the costs of being less
or unable to differentiate newcomers from hostiles. 
For example, the preference-tracking service
at <a href="http://www.fireflycom/">www.firefly.com</a> increases participation via the use of pseudonyms, thereby protecting customers from exposure
to strangers who might abuse that information.
On the other hand, credit transactions
typically demand identifying information, because the contractual exposure
typically outweighs benefits of privity. </p>

<p>Global name public keys, which have many drawbacks in terms of privity,
may be the best way to track negative reputation, but they are no panacea.
There is an important conundrum in an ID-based key system: the conflict
between the ability to get a new key when the old one is or could be abused
by another (key revocation), and the ability of another to be sure they
are dealing with the same person again. This may also provide an opportunity
for parties to selectively reveal positive credentials and hide negative
ones. For example, a person with a bad credit rating could revoke the key
under which that rating is distributed and create a new one, while selectively
updating their positive credentials to the new key (e.g., have their alma
mater create a new diploma). 

</p><p>The current universal (non-cryptographic) key in the U.S., the social security number (SSN), is very difficult
to revoke; it's much easier to change your name. This policy
is probably no accident, since the biggest economic win of global name 
identification is the tracking of negative reputations, which revocation can defeat. As
long as the SSN is a shared database key, not used for the purpose of securely
identifying a faceless transaction, there is little need for revocation
beyond the undesired erasure of negative history. Combining a secret authentication
key, which must be revocable, with a public universal ID is quite problematic.</p>
<a name"credit"=""></a><h2>Credit</h2>
One of the basic outstanding problems in smart contracts is the 
ensurement of credit. This comes up not only in loans,
but in any other contract which involves a temporal lag between 
performance and reciprocal performance of the contractual terms.  
<p>
In current practice, there are several partially effective processes for 
ensuring future performance: 
</p><p>
* Reputation (especially credit reports): often effective, but only
to a point, as it is often hard for the debtor to accurately judge the
future reputational effects of an action (e.g., failure to pay a bill, taking
out too large a loan, etc.) that has clear, local, beneficial effects today.
There is more imbalance in knowledge between current and distant consequences
among individual consumers, but even among large organizations with high
credit ratings it is not an irrelevant factor. 
</p><p>* Secured transactions: liens, escrow, etc.
</p><p>* Garnishment of future income 
</p><p>* Law enforcement, especially to enforce transfer of control over liened
assets, garnishment, etc. 
</p><p>
These processes have a fundamental property in common - they violate
the privity of credit transactions - in other words, they bring in 
third parties to track reputations or enforce repayment. Do credit 
transactions entail a fundamental imbalance in incentives that can only be 
redressed by bringing in third parties, or can the security protocols
be discovered which allow credit with minimal or no third party 
involvement?
</p><p>
</p><h4>Local Name Credit Ratings</h4>
Three important variables have been proposed for reputation economics:
<pre><i>operating value</i>: expected future profits, given the reputation
<i>throw-away value</i>: profit from cheating, which ruins reputation
<i>replacement cost</i>: cost of recreating reputation
</pre>
<p>
In turn, Peter Swire [ <a href="#17">17</a> ] describes two problems facing inadequately
secured or unsecured loans to "credit names":
</p><p>
<i>Adverse selection</i>: Prior deadbeats can start fresh by signing 
up for the 
new service. Going in, it will be biased in favor of deadbeats. This 
problem may be addressed by using Chaumian credentials. These allow the
established positive reputations of previous names to be carried over 
to the credit name, without allowing anyone to link the two names.
Entrants without positive reputations can be rejected.
</p><p>
<i>The endgame problem</i>: A credit name can establish a good credit rating 
over time. When the limit is high enough, the borrower can quickly 
spend it all. A malicious borrower, with a good rating established 
under a previous name, can systematically profit at the expense of the 
lender, if the throw-away value is greater than the replacement cost.
To address this problem, creditors will have to charge higher rates to new 
credit names and raise credit limits more slowly than for traceable names.  
Honest borrowers will subsidize the dishonest, to an even greater extent
than they do in the current credit card system.
</p><p>
</p><h4>Secured Credit</h4><p>
Secured credit need not violate privity if the physical control over
the securing property can be shared. So that, for example, automobile credit
can be secured as long as repossession is possible, as described in the
example above. 
</p><p>
A standard mechanism of secured credit applicable online is the
escrow. An escrow is an intermediary trusted to hold messages
until messages from both sides are received, and, optionally,
their contents verified - to extent the content is verifiable,
and at the expense of some privity. The escrow then sends the
messages off to their recipients, along with receipts. Messages 
can contain any sort of data: content, a bearer certificate, etc.
</p><p>
</p><h4>Ripped Instruments</h4>
<p>
Alice wants a New York City cab ride for which she's willing to pay
$100, but she doesn't trust Bob the taxi driver to get her there on time
if she pays up front. Bob in turn doesn't trust Alice to pay at the end
of the trip. Commerce can be consummated by Alice tearing a $100 bill and
giving half to Bob. After the trip she gives the other half to Bob, which
he can then reassemble into a negotiable $100 bill. Alice loses her incentive
to not pay. Bob gains incentive to get her there on time as promised. Both
have made what economists call a "credible commitment" to perform
their respective parts of the contract.  
<a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/markus/">Markus Jacobsson</a> 
has digitized this idea, coming up with a protocol for ripped digital cash. 
As with many other aspects of digital cash, the
idea can be further generalized to rip some other kinds of bearer
instruments -- specifically, those whose value can be divided roughly
in half.                   
If the transfer is double-blinded the 
transfer agent has no knowledge of the participants and therefore no bias 
to favor one over the other. The transfer agent must, however, be able to 
assess proof of performance, and the protocol is only workable where such 
proof (in the form of proof of receipt of a message, for example) is 
available.</p><p>
The ripped bill is similar to using the transfer agent as an escrow 
agent. An advantage over using an escrow agent is that the
need for extra anonymous channels between the parties and the escrow is
avoided. A disadvantage is that the transfer agent now has taken on the
major additional job of acting as an adjudicator, assessing proofs of performance
(or at the very least, must be responsible for subcontracting out this
job and implementing the adjudicator's judgement).
</p><p></p><h4>Credit Cards</h4>
<p>
Credit cards provide relatively little protection from third
parties, especially in the area of privacy, but they do have an 
interesting contractual feature worth noting, the chargeback. With 
chargebacks customers can get refunds on allegedly unwanted merchandise.   
The issuer tracks the number of chargebacks both for customers and merchants;
too many chargebacks can get you booted out of the system. This provides 
an efficient mechanism for refunds without resorting to expensive tort
proceedings. Many customers who read the fine print or otherwise learn about 
chargeback limits often do chargebacks despite receiving and
enjoying the merchandise; there is no practical way for the issuer
to detect such fraud, and so it can only be pruned by limiting
the number of chargebacks per customer. Some merchants complain 
vociferously about such customer "theft", and it seems to make
possible coordinated attacks to put merchants out of business,
but nevertheless 
merchants sign up for credit cards, because that's what their customers 
have signed up for. The chargeback feature makes customers more
comfortable purchasing goods of unknown quality, especially mail-order
and over the Internet. Chargeback provides a crude but 
effective partial solution to the information asymmetry problem between 
retailers and consumers.  
</p><p>
</p><h4>Interval Instruments</h4><p>
"Time release" money that becomes
good only after a certain date, and "interval money", that would expire
after a certain date have been proposed. These can be implemented
by a digital mint expiring or activating special issues of digital cash,
or by a third party issuing escrowed keys at specific times. Since these
keys are encrypted against the escrow agent, and that agent doesn't know
what they will be used for, the escrow agent has no incentive to cheat.
A generalization of this is that transfer and redeemability are each 
associated with interval sets, or validity periods when each can and 
cannot be performed. This is analogous to clipping coupons on bonds.
</p><p>
</p><h4>Known Borrowers of Unknown Amounts</h4><p>
Hal Finney [ <a href="#18">18</a> ] has described a loan mix, to unlink
borrowers from amount borrowed. The identity of the potential
borrowers is still 
public, as well as the system for enforcing payment, but the actual 
amount loaned or borrowed remains 
unknown. The system starts with participants putting unknown amounts into 
a pot and getting receipts (bearer bonds) for these amount. All 
participants then borrow a standard amount. Whether a participant is a 
net borrower or a net creditor, and of what amount, remains private. When 
the loan is due all participants repay the standard amount, and the creditors 
reclaim the amounts on their bearer bonds. The amount actually 
borrowed (or, if negative, loaned) is the public amount borrowed minus 
the amount put into the pot. One consequence is that while negative
reputations can still be accumulated when participants fail
to pay back the standard amount, positive reputations
are minimal, since participants who borrow and loan are indistinguishable.
If future creditors put stock in positive participation, one could
gain a credit rating by perpetually participating as a net borrower
of zero, by loaning and borrowing the same amounts.</p><p>
<a name="Conclusion"></a></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
Smart contracts combine protocols, users interfaces, and promises 
expressed via those interfaces, to formalize and secure relationships 
over public networks. This gives us new ways to formalize the digital 
relationships which are far more functional than their inanimate 
paper-based ancestors. Smart contracts reduce mental and computational 
transaction costs, imposed by either principals, third parties, or 
their tools.
</p><p>
Mark Miller [ <a href="#19">19</a> ] foresees that the law of the Internet, and the devices
attached to it, will be provided by a grand merger of law and computer 
security. If so, smart contracts will be a major force behind this merger.
