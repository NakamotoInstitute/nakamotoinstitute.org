    <p><em>From The Road to Tycho, a collection of articles about the
    antecedents of the Lunarian Revolution, published in Luna City in
    2096.</em></p>

    <p>For Dan Halbert, the road to Tycho began in college—when Lissa Lenz
    asked to borrow his computer. Hers had broken down, and unless she could
    borrow another, she would fail her midterm project. There was no one she
    dared ask, except Dan.</p>

    <p>This put Dan in a dilemma. He had to help her—but if he lent her his
    computer, she might read his books. Aside from the fact that you could go
    to prison for many years for letting someone else read your books, the very
    idea shocked him at first. Like everyone, he had been taught since
    elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong—something that
    only pirates would do.</p>

    <p>And there wasn't much chance that the SPA—the Software Protection
    Authority—would fail to catch him. In his software class, Dan had learned
    that each book had a copyright monitor that reported when and where it was
    read, and by whom, to Central Licensing. (They used this information to
    catch reading pirates, but also to sell personal interest profiles to
    retailers.) The next time his computer was networked, Central Licensing
    would find out. He, as computer owner, would receive the harshest
    punishment—for not taking pains to prevent the crime.</p>

    <p>Of course, Lissa did not necessarily intend to read his books. She might
    want the computer only to write her midterm. But Dan knew she came from a
    middle-class family and could hardly afford the tuition, let alone her
    reading fees. Reading his books might be the only way she could graduate.
    He understood this situation; he himself had had to borrow to pay for all
    the research papers he read. (Ten percent of those fees went to the
    researchers who wrote the papers; since Dan aimed for an academic career,
    he could hope that his own research papers, if frequently referenced, would
    bring in enough to repay this loan.)</p>

    <p>Later on, Dan would learn there was a time when anyone could go to the
    library and read journal articles, and even books, without having to pay.
    There were independent scholars who read thousands of pages without
    government library grants. But in the 1990s, both commercial and nonprofit
    journal publishers had begun charging fees for access. By 2047, libraries
    offering free public access to scholarly literature were a dim memory.</p>

    <p>There were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central Licensing.
    They were themselves illegal. Dan had had a classmate in software, Frank
    Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool, and used it to skip
    over the copyright monitor code when reading books. But he had told too
    many friends about it, and one of them turned him in to the SPA for a
    reward (students deep in debt were easily tempted into betrayal). In 2047,
    Frank was in prison, not for pirate reading, but for possessing a
    debugger.</p>

    <p>Dan would later learn that there was a time when anyone could have
    debugging tools. There were even free debugging tools available on CD or
    downloadable over the net. But ordinary users started using them to bypass
    copyright monitors, and eventually a judge ruled that this had become their
    principal use in actual practice. This meant they were illegal; the
    debuggers' developers were sent to prison.</p>

    <p>Programmers still needed debugging tools, of course, but debugger
    vendors in 2047 distributed numbered copies only, and only to officially
    licensed and bonded programmers. The debugger Dan used in software class
    was kept behind a special firewall so that it could be used only for class
    exercises.</p>

    <p>It was also possible to bypass the copyright monitors by installing a
    modified system kernel. Dan would eventually find out about the free
    kernels, even entire free operating systems, that had existed around the
    turn of the century. But not only were they illegal, like debuggers—you
    could not install one if you had one, without knowing your computer's root
    password. And neither the FBI nor Microsoft Support would tell you
    that.</p>

    <p>Dan concluded that he couldn't simply lend Lissa his computer. But he
    couldn't refuse to help her, because he loved her. Every chance to speak
    with her filled him with delight. And that she chose him to ask for help,
    that could mean she loved him too.</p>

    <p>Dan resolved the dilemma by doing something even more unthinkable—he
    lent her the computer, and told her his password. This way, if Lissa read
    his books, Central Licensing would think he was reading them. It was still
    a crime, but the SPA would not automatically find out about it. They would
    only find out if Lissa reported him.</p>

    <p>Of course, if the school ever found out that he had given Lissa his own
    password, it would be curtains for both of them as students, regardless of
    what she had used it for. School policy was that any interference with
    their means of monitoring students' computer use was grounds for
    disciplinary action. It didn't matter whether you did anything harmful—the
    offense was making it hard for the administrators to check on you. They
    assumed this meant you were doing something else forbidden, and they did
    not need to know what it was.</p>

    <p>Students were not usually expelled for this—not directly. Instead they
    were banned from the school computer systems, and would inevitably fail all
    their classes.</p>

    <p>Later, Dan would learn that this kind of university policy started only
    in the 1980s, when university students in large numbers began using
    computers. Previously, universities maintained a different approach to
    student discipline; they punished activities that were harmful, not those
    that merely raised suspicion.</p>

    <p>Lissa did not report Dan to the SPA. His decision to help her led to
    their marriage, and also led them to question what they had been taught
    about piracy as children. The couple began reading about the history of
    copyright, about the Soviet Union and its restrictions on copying, and even
    the original United States Constitution. They moved to Luna, where they
    found others who had likewise gravitated away from the long arm of the SPA.
    When the Tycho Uprising began in 2062, the universal right to read soon
    became one of its central aims.</p>

    <h3>Author's Note</h3><em>This note has been updated several times since
    the first publication of the story.</em>

    <p>The right to read is a battle being fought today. Although it may take
    50 years for our present way of life to fade into obscurity, most of the
    specific laws and practices described above have already been proposed;
    many have been enacted into law in the US and elsewhere. In the US, the
    1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) established the legal basis to
    restrict the reading and lending of computerized books (and other works as
    well). The European Union imposed similar restrictions in a 2001 copyright
    directive. In France, under the DADVSI law adopted in 2006, mere possession
    of a copy of DeCSS, the free program to decrypt video on a DVD, is a
    crime.</p>

    <p>In 2001, Disney-funded Senator Hollings proposed a bill called the SSSCA
    that would require every new computer to have mandatory copy-restriction
    facilities that the user cannot bypass. Following the Clipper chip and
    similar US government key-escrow proposals, this shows a long-term trend:
    computer systems are increasingly set up to give absentees with clout
    control over the people actually using the computer system. The SSSCA was
    later renamed to the unpronounceable CBDTPA, which was glossed as the
    "Consume But Don't Try Programming Act."</p>

    <p>The Republicans took control of the US senate shortly thereafter. They
    are less tied to Hollywood than the Democrats, so they did not press these
    proposals. Now that the Democrats are back in control, the danger is once
    again higher.</p>

    <p>In 2001 the US began attempting to use the proposed Free Trade Area of
    the Americas (FTAA) treaty to impose the same rules on all the countries in
    the Western Hemisphere. The FTAA is one of the so-called free trade
    treaties, which are actually designed to give business increased power over
    democratic governments; imposing laws like the DMCA is typical of this
    spirit. The FTAA was effectively killed by Lula, President of Brazil, who
    rejected the DMCA requirement and others.</p>

    <p>Since then, the US has imposed similar requirements on countries such as
    Australia and Mexico through bilateral "free trade" agreements, and on
    countries such as Costa Rica through another treaty, CAFTA. Ecuador's
    President Correa refused to sign a "free trade" agreement with the US, but
    I've heard Ecuador had adopted something like the DMCA in 2003.</p>

    <p>One of the ideas in the story was not proposed in reality until 2002.
    This is the idea that the FBI and Microsoft will keep the root passwords
    for your personal computers, and not let you have them.</p>

    <p>The proponents of this scheme have given it names such as "trusted
    computing" and "Palladium." We call it <a href=
    "https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/can-you-trust.html">"treacherous
    computing"</a> because the effect is to make your computer obey companies
    even to the extent of disobeying and defying you. This was implemented in
    2007 as part of <a href="http://badvista.org/">Windows Vista</a>; we expect
    Apple to do something similar. In this scheme, it is the manufacturer that
    keeps the secret code, but the FBI would have little trouble getting
    it.</p>

    <p>What Microsoft keeps is not exactly a password in the traditional sense;
    no person ever types it on a terminal. Rather, it is a signature and
    encryption key that corresponds to a second key stored in your computer.
    This enables Microsoft, and potentially any web sites that cooperate with
    Microsoft, the ultimate control over what the user can do on his own
    computer.</p>

    <p>Vista also gives Microsoft additional powers; for instance, Microsoft
    can forcibly install upgrades, and it can order all machines running Vista
    to refuse to run a certain device driver. The main purpose of Vista's many
    restrictions is to impose DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) that users
    can't overcome. The threat of DRM is why we have established the <a href=
    "http://defectivebydesign.org/">Defective by Design</a> campaign.</p>

    <p>When this story was first written, the SPA was threatening small
    Internet service providers, demanding they permit the SPA to monitor all
    users. Most ISPs surrendered when threatened, because they cannot afford to
    fight back in court. One ISP, Community ConneXion in Oakland, California,
    refused the demand and was actually sued. The SPA later dropped the suit,
    but obtained the DMCA, which gave them the power they sought.</p>

    <p>The SPA, which actually stands for Software Publishers Association, has
    been replaced in its police-like role by the Business Software Alliance.
    The BSA is not, today, an official police force; unofficially, it acts like
    one. Using methods reminiscent of the erstwhile Soviet Union, it invites
    people to inform on their coworkers and friends. A BSA terror campaign in
    Argentina in 2001 made slightly veiled threats that people sharing software
    would be raped.</p>

    <p>The university security policies described above are not imaginary. For
    example, a computer at one Chicago-area university displayed this message
    upon login:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <em>This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals
        using this computer system without authority or in the excess of their
        authority are subject to having all their activities on this system
        monitored and recorded by system personnel. In the course of monitoring
        individuals improperly using this system or in the course of system
        maintenance, the activities of authorized user may also be monitored.
        Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and is
        advised that if such monitoring reveals possible evidence of illegal
        activity or violation of University regulations system personnel may
        provide the evidence of such monitoring to University authorities
        and/or law enforcement officials.</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is an interesting approach to the Fourth Amendment: pressure most
    everyone to agree, in advance, to waive their rights under it.</p>

    <p>The battle for the right to read is already in progress. The enemy is
    organized, while we are not, so it is going against us. Here are articles
