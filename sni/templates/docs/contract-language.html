<h3>A Formal Language for Analyzing Contracts</h3>

The author presents a mini-language for
<!-- lawyers, legal
scholars, economists, legal and economic historians, business 
analysts, accountants, auditors,
and others
-->
professionals and researchers interested in drafting and
analyzing contracts.   It is intended for
computers to read, too.  
The main purpose of this language is to, as unambiguously
and completely and succinctly as possible, specify common 
contracts or contractual terms.  These include financial contracts,
liens and other kinds of security, transfer of ownership, 
performance of online services, and supply chain workflow.
</p><p>
The following problems may be addressed by the language when
interpreted by computer:
</p><ul>
<li> Accounting and auditing.  Sophisticated contracts, including
derivatives and combinations, can be specified in our formal language.
Then automated or manual accounting rules may be applied to
convert transactions completed under the contract to audit trails
and ledger entries.
</li><li> Analyze formally specified contracts for flaws in
logic, scheduling, opportunities for parties to breach the
contract, and conflicts with other contracts one is already
committed to.[5]
</li><li> Translate the formal contracts into an existing 
programming language such as E [1], and/or cryptographic protocols[2],
for partially self-enforcing and protected execution as
<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/idea.html"> smart contracts</a>.
</li><li>Some kinds of contracts, especially financial and commodity
contracts and their derivatives, can be converted into a decision or 
game tree that can be analyzed to determine risk, net present value, etc.
</li></ul>
<p>
The process of designing
this language is also a great way to explore the basic nature of
contracts (what are the "elements" out of which a wide variety
of useful contracts
can be drafted?) and their composibility (what rules for composing
these atoms rule out impossible contracts?)  The language is
also a creative tool for thinking up and "sketching"
new kinds of contracts.  I welcome your participation.
</p><p>

The words in our language
follow legal terminology as much as possible -- thus for example
<i>performance</i> means execution 
to satisfy the terms of the contract
(as in the legal field), rather than measured quantities like speed, memory 
usage,
bandwidth, etc. (as programmers use the term).  A law degree is not
required to use the language, but some familiarity with contract
law and the drafting of contracts is recommended.
A lawyer who did reasonably well on the analytical and logical
sections of the U.S. LSAT or its overseas equivalent, will, I suspect, 
have better luck drafting contracts in this language than than a 
programmer whose sole experience lies in traditional procedural 
language.  That is why I call this a <i>drafting
language</i> not a programming language.
</p><p>



Our language can specify the output of a negotiation
(which could be an auction, an exchange, or two parties drafting the
contract, or one party drafting and the other agreeing to
it, etc. ).  It also can define the input to an engine that drives and monitors 
the transactions that perform the contract:

</p><pre>negotiation --&gt; contract --&gt; performance
</pre>
<p>
Performance of the contract, i.e. its reification as a smart contract,
can thus be seen as (hypothetical, at this point) execution of a program 
written in our language.  
Furthermore, our language incorporates a wide variety of contractual terms, 
not just abstract monetary terms and their derivatives.  These two 
characteristics make our language very different 
from special purpose financial contract languages such as [3].  While 
we use several financial contract examples to introduce our language and
demonstrate its flexibility, its scope
both in functionality and the kinds of contracts and transaction
protocols it can represent is far broader.
<br>
</p><h3>Semantics</h3>
Each word and phrase in our language has a clear standard meaning.
As a result, contracts can be drafted that will be far less subject to
disputes over interpretation.  On the other hand, the language is
not very good at expressing many subjective and ambiguous concepts
that are often necessary in contracts.  Nor is it any good, in its
present state, in referring to jurisdictions or doctrines of law.
The language is nevertheless very different from a traditional programming
language.  Contractual
terms are defined in terms of events that trigger their performance.
Such events include dates and times, choices made by the parties, 
observable breaches of contract, and so on.  
<p>
Our language is not a markup language.   It is not about manipulating
text for the purposes of drafting contracts.
It is not about structuring text, specifying fill-out forms, defining 
static data formats, or similar tasks of languages such as HTML or XML.
For those tasks one should use a markup language, or a text-manipulating
programming language (e.g. Perl), not this language.
Our language does something very different.  It models the dynamics
of contract performance -- when and under what conditions obligations
should be performed.
</p><p>
The words and sentences of the
language do not consist of instructions followed down the 
page from one step to the next.  Instead, a contract
is read (both by human and computer) by following nested definitions of 
contractual terms as they expand, and by
looking at events in <b>when</b> statements and seeing what they trigger.
If the drafter does need to explicitly 
construct a step by step calendar schedule, this can be done by
using calendar-driven events or words like <b>for</b> and <b>then</b>.
</p><p>
The language encourages composition of contracts.  Contracts, rights,
and obligations can be nested.   We call these nested structures
<i>clauses</i>.  Contracts and clauses involve two parties,
the <i>Holder</i>, from whose point of view we read the
contract, and a <i>Counterparty</i>.  Multi-party agreements can
be drafted by composing several two-party contracts.
</p><p>

<br>
</p><h3>Example -- Futures Contract</h3>
Our first example is a well-known financial contract, the <i>future</i>.
A future is an obligation on the part of the Holder
of the futures contract to purchase a certain amount of a certain 
commodity in a certain month, and the obligation on the part of the
future contract writer, the Counterparty, to deliver these goods. 
For the purposes of introducing this contract, we give it in the abstract
form in which financial analysts usually deal with it, leaving out 
important details that describe the third parties who act as
trusted intermediaries to define "fair bundles" of commodities,
and we also leave out many details about the actual delivery.
<pre>future(rightA="1 round lot pork bellies", 
       rightB="$1,500.00", 
       p = "for delivery in July 2002") = 
	
	when withinPeriod(p) 
		to Holder rightA   with   to Counterparty rightB 
   	then terminate
</pre>
Since this language is not yet being computer interpreted, the syntax
is designed more for human than computer readability.  I will 
be a bit fast and loose with the syntax, and you can be too.    I
mostly use tabs instead of brackets {} to structure clauses in a way that 
seems natural and readable to me -- and I hope to you -- but might 
confuse a computer.
Feel free to develop your own style. 
<p>
The top three lines in the contract,
in the form <b>name(parameters) = </b>
tells us that we are defining a <i>named clause</i>.  
The named
clause can define an entire contract or just a clause in a larger
contract.  We can pass the names of other named clauses, lists of events,
and other kinds of information that the named clause needs -- these
are the parameters.</p><p>
 
<b>when withinPeriod(p)</b> means "when the first calendar or clock
event generated during period p". 
The drafter can elsewhere set how often this regular "clock tick" event
occurs.  The first such clock tick after the start of the period,
in this case the first scheduled delivery day in the month of July,
triggers the clause with the brackets {}.  More sophisticated
schedules are possible, such as those that minimize delivery costs
for the Counterparty by delivering to different Holders on different
days in July.  
Fortunately, we can hide these scheduling details within the
calendar event and schedule iterator mechanisms, leaving the
drafter free from worrying about exactly when markets are open,
which days are weekends or holidays or leap days, and the like.  
The Counterparty's delivery schedule can be negotiated
or this detail can be left up to the Counterparty.  In the contract
above, the constraints on delivery are that it occur within July
and only in conjunction with payment from the Holder.
<!-- This indented clause after the <b>when</b>
is called a "contract clause" since it contains a right
clause for each party (that is, there is mutual consideration, each
party has at least one right and at least one obligation under the
contract clause).  Because contracts,
especially the kinds written in our language, can often be 
composed by combining smaller contracts, sometimes such a clause is 
even just called a "contract". -->
</p><p>
The innermost clause says to swap <b>rightA</b> for <b>rightB</b>.
This clause is split into a Holder right and a Counterparty right.
The right clause <b> Holder rightA</b> means "Holder has the right
to performance of rightA", in this case delivery of the pork bellies.
The clause <b> Counterparty rightB</b> means "Counterparty has the
right to performance of rightB", which here is the payment of 1,500 dollars.
<b>with</b> indicates a simultaneous swap -- the two transactions should
occur together, perhaps intermediated by an escrow agent to enforce
both the delivery and payment terms.
</p><p>

A <b>then</b> statement allows us to proceed step by
step.  If we had two clauses
written thus
</p><pre>	to Holder right1
	also to Holder right2
</pre>
they could be performed in any order -- right2 might be performed
first, or right1 might be, or (most likely) performance on both
might proceed at the sime time.   Several <b>when</b> statements
nested together at the same level have any implicit <b>also</b>
as they can be triggered in any order.
<p>
<!-- Unless the drafter needs to constrain
the performance to fit a calendar schedule, or must ensure that 
one clause must be performed before another, it is best to let
them be performed in any order as above.  This makes for more 
simplicity and flexibility in the analysis and performance of the
contract. -->
Envision a dancing elf that follows nesting of clauses as they
are performed and of events as they are caught.  
(Programmers call this dancing elf by the boring name "instruction
 pointer").  There can be more than one dancing elf if there is an 
<b>also</b> or if more than one when statement is triggered while another 
is active, but usually we only need to think about one at a time.
</p><p>
If we wish to add the constraint that right2 cannot be 
performed until right1 has been, we use <b>then</b>:
</p><pre>	to Holder right1
	then to Holder right2
</pre>
Traditional programmers will be sorely tempted to fill their contracts with
<b>then</b> statements, mimicking the style of procedural programming.
Do not!  Those experienced with drafting contracts 
know that is some cases such a constraint is clearly 
appropriate and in some cases it clearly isn't, and it is
important when adding constraints to be explicit.  Therefore
the following statement is illegal, and will be rejected both
by the computer and by any right-thinking drafters working
without a computer:
<pre># Do not do this!
	to Holder right1
	to Holder right2
</pre>
Finally, we have already seen this kind of clause:
<pre>	to Holder right1
	with to Holder right2
</pre>     
This means that right1 and right2 should be performed
simultaneously -- and either both of them should be
performed, or neither of them.  In the lingo of computer scientists, it 
should be an "atomic" transaction.
<p>
The <b>then terminate</b> at the end of the named clause ensures 
that all rights and obligations under the contract are 
terminated once it has been performed.  It is not 
triggered until the 
one-line body of the future contract has been completed.
as well as any outstanding subordinate clauses with their rights 
and obligations.  This clause is implicit at the end of every
named clause, but for this one time we make it explicit.  This
clause is often used explicitly when the drafter wants to ensure
the proper termination of non-named clauses nested within a named
clause.
</p><p>
Let's now proceed through the futures contract step by step, as
clauses are activated and then performed.  
A normal font indicates the clause is inactive. 
A <b>bold</b> font
indicates an active state -- the clauses is being performed.
</p><p>
When the parties commit to the contract its first clauses
(the clauses at the highest level of indentation)
are awoken.  In our futures contract we have only one
such clause, and so the <b>when</b> (but not the clauses
nested underneath it) go to in an active state, waiting for the
<b>withinPeriod()</b> event:
</p><pre>	<b>when withinPeriod(p) </b>
		to Holder rightA   with   to Counterparty rightB 
   	then terminate
</pre>
When the calendar has advanced to the end of trading on the last
trading day of August, the <b>withinPeriod(p)</b> event occurs
and the <b>when</b> activates the clauses nested at the
next level inside.  The when itself becomes inactive -- it is no longer
waiting for an event:
<pre>	when withinPeriod(p) 
		<b>to Holder rightA   with   to Counterparty rightB </b>
   	then terminate
</pre>
The <b>then</b> has cause the <b>terminate</b> to wait for 
the <b>when</b> and its subclauses to be performed.  
Once the swap of rights has been performed, the performed clauses
convert to inactivity and the terminate fires:
<pre>	when withinPeriod(p) 
		to Holder rightA   with   to Counterparty rightB 
   	then <b>terminate</b>
</pre>
<p>
It is easy to generalize in our language.  The
generic futures contract looks like this:
</p><pre>future(rightA, rightB, p) = 
	when withinPeriod(p) 
		to Holder rightA   with   to Counterparty rightB 
   	then terminate
</pre>
Instead of pork bellies, we can swap any
other <b>rightA</b> for <b>rightB</b>,
which can be a wide variety of things beside money.  Drafters
can specify very general boilerplate and fill in details for
specific contracts later.
<p>
</p><h3>Example -- Option Contract</h3>
We now present another kind of financial contract. In
this <i>American option</i>, the Holder has the right to buy for
$20 (the option strike price) per share one round lot (100 shares) of XYZ Corp
on or before the last trading day of August.
These kinds of contracts are called "derivatives" because the call 
option is derived from the underlying right (here a stock).

<pre>callOptionAmerican (rightA="1 round lot XYZ Corp.", 
		    rightB="$2,000/lot", 
		    time="end of trading on last trading day of August") =
	when beforeTime(time) 
     		when choiceOf(Holder) 
			to Holder rightA with to Counterparty rightB
	when afterTime(time) 
		terminate 
</pre>
<p>
Think about that dancing elf again.  (When reading or writing in our
language it's important to follow these dancing elves.  If the elves 
become
annoying, think
of some other dynamic character or process for a metaphor that suits). 
As it goes around
it wakes up clauses, making them active, causing them to be performed.
Sometimes there can be more than one elf dancing through the
code at the same time,
for example if more than one when statement is triggered while another 
is active, but usually we only need to think about one at a time.
</p><p>
The contract starts out with dancing elves in the two top-level
clauses:
</p><pre>	<b>when beforeTime(time) </b>
     		when choiceOf(Holder) 
			to Holder rightA with to Counterparty rightB
	<b>when afterTime(time) </b>
		terminate 
</pre>
These when statements are now waiting for their respective events.
Since the events are mutually exclusive (it is first <b>beforeTime(time)</b>,
then <b>afterTime(time)</b>, but never both) we only need to worry about
the first to be executed.  Note that, unless separated by a <b>then</b>,
the order of the clauses at the same level is not important.  The
following code is identical to the code in our example:
<pre>	when afterTime(time) 
		terminate 
	when beforeTime(time) 
     		when choiceOf(Holder) 
			to Holder rightA with to Counterparty rightB
</pre>
The <b>beforeTime(time)</b> is immediately activiated,
so that we start with the nested clause(s) at the level immediate below
it active as well -- in this case, <b>when choiceOf(Holder)</b>.
<pre>	when beforeTime(time)
     		<b>when choiceOf(Holder) </b>
			to Holder rightA with to Counterparty rightB
	<b>when afterTime(time) </b>
		terminate 
</pre>
  A series of whenes at the same level
in that clause all start waiting for any of them to be triggered.
When a when receives an event  thrown below it or at it, the
nested clause below it becomes active.  Then the clauses below it become 
active and are performed down to the wheness one level below.  The
whenes at that level go from inactive to active, now waiting for
their events to occur.
<p>
The <b>when beforeTime(time)</b> becomes active when the option itself
is first activated, and remains active until <b>time</b>.  Being
active it wakes up the <b>when choiceOf(Holder)</b>.  This
when specifies the event that gives
the contract its nature as an option -- the choice of its holder
to exercise it or not.  
If the Holder chooses to do so, the Holder
gets the stock (<b>rightA</b>) from the Counterparty (the writer of the call
option) in exchange for the money (<b>rightB</b>).    The dancing
elves then move from the <b>when</b> clause to the swap clause:
</p><pre>	when beforeTime(time)
     		when choiceOf(Holder)
			<b>to Holder rightA with to Counterparty rightB</b>
	<b>when afterTime(time) </b>
		terminate 
</pre>
<p>
When code gets complicated, we might not be able to easily
tell whether the implicit <b>then terminate</b> on the last line
will get executed. So it's a good idea to
to <b>terminate</b> the
contract explicitly when the option expires.
</p><p>
We will see examples where more than one kind of event, and even
sequences of events (such as a calender schedule of payment dates)
trigger the execution of contractual terms.
</p><p>
<!-- Here is the same contract in a more general form.
<pre>
callOptionAmerican(rightA, rightB, time) = 
	when beforeTime(time)
     		when choiceOf(Holder) 
			to Holder rightA   with   to Counterparty rightB
	when afterTime(time) 
		terminate 
</pre> -->

</p><p>
Remember that the language does not proceed by default
step by step -- instead the reader (human or computer) should
follow down the nested contract definitions as they expand, and
look at events in <b>when</b> statements to see what they trigger.
Explicit step by step calendar schedules can be built using 
<b>for</b>, <b>then</b>, and calendar events.
</p><p>
Here's an example that uses such explicit steps.
A <i>bond</i> makes a sequence of fixed payments,
called <i>coupons</i>, on a regular schedule, and then makes a final
payment, the <i>principal</i>.  We don't show here the details of the
schedule itself, but in general a schedule could be defined to be
any kind of temporal sequence -- we could pay out coupons on
the last day of every month, on every Japanese holiday, according
to the computation of Easter (don't laugh -- schedulers
of medieval fairs had to face this problem), or however we choose.
When implemented the calendar events and schedule iterator will
contain a very thorough implementation that solves many of the nasty
calendar problems that often appear in transaction processing systems.
</p><p>
<b>for</b> iterates through the events in the schedule one by
one, with the nested <b>when</b> handling them.  When it appears
after a <b>for</b> clause, a <b>then</b> advances the iterator one
more step.
</p><pre>bond(coupon, principal, schedule) = 
	for schedule 
		when withinPeriod(schedule.next) 
			to Holder coupon
	then
 	when withinPeriod(schedule.next) 
		to Holder principal 
</pre>
<p>
Next we sketch a contract to sell a car on credit.  Being a sketch
rather than a full-fledged design, this is an 
oversimplified or "toy" example -- 
we leave out fees, any references to a related insurance
contract, warrantees, waivers, etc.  We also for simplicity have the 
bank (here the Holder)
be the same as the car dealer.  
Finally, we don't show here any lien on the car to secure the loan.
We will make a stab at a lien-like mechanism in an example below.


</p><pre>loanPayments(payment, schedule) =
	for schedule 
		when withinPeriod(schedule.next) 
			payment 
carPurchase(car, downPayment, monthlyPayment, schedule)  = 
	to Counterparty getTitle(car)   with   to Holder downPayment 
	then to Holder loanPayment(monthlyPayment, schedule)
</pre>
If we want to allow prepayment, our schedule would contain single
times rather than periods with a begin time and an end time.  And
our loan payments would look as follows:
<pre>loanPayments(payment, schedule) =
	for schedule
		when beforeTime(schedule.next) 
			payment
</pre>     
We could compute the above payment from other information we
are more likely to see in the contract, but this involves
just normal programming.  We can use a function to perform
the computation in the first place:
<pre>loanPayments(principal, interest, schedule) =
	constant payment.amount = computeInterest(principal, schedule, interest)
		# normal computational function goes here
	then for schedule
		when beforeTime(schedule.next) 
			payment
</pre>
"=" sets, for all time (thus <b>constant</b>), the number <b>payment.amount</b> 
to the value returned by the function <b>computeInterest</b>.
<!--  We can 
also make <b>payment a variable, that is an object whose value could
change,  and use the function as an <i>invariant condition</i> to make sure
the payment is proper is made in the proper amount, using the 
<b>==</b> and <b>if/else</b> constructions:
<pre>
variable payment.amount = computeInterest(principal, schedule, interest)
	# normal computational function goes here
loanPayments(principal, schedule, interest) =
        for schedule
                when beforeTime(schedule.next) 	
			if (payment.amount == computeInterest(principal, schedule, interest)
			payment
-->


We could also do more complicated things -- deduct interest for
prepayment, or conversely add prepayment penalties, or a wide
variety of other conditions.
<p>
We can also structure the car purchase contract so that the
new owner doesn't get the title until after the downPayment
has been received:
</p><pre>carPurchase(car, downPayment, monthlyPayment, schedule)  =
	to Holder downPayment 
	then to Counterparty getTitle(car) 
	then to Holder loanPayments(monthlyPayment, schedule) 
</pre>

<br>
<h3>Damage Clauses</h3>
Let's use our language to analyze some important advances
in the history of economic institutions.
Genoa was an
independent and rather libertarian (for its time) city heavily
involved in the Mediterranean sea trade.
During its height in the twelth through
fifteenth centuries it developed many commercial innovations, including
two we will examine here, the "dry exchange" loan and pooled-risk
insurance.
<p>
Here is a
clause from a contract made in Genoa on June 23 in
1271 A.D.  A man is co-signing an obligation being made by
his son:
</p><pre>Wherefore and for which we promise, both of us [liable] for the whole
amount, to give and to pay to you or to your accredited messenger
53 gold hyperpers, good and of correct weight, in Romania [Byzantium].
by the Kalends of September.  If, however, we do not give you these
[hyperpers] within the said time limit, [we promise] for each of the said 
hyperpers 11 shillings Genoese in Genoa whenever you wish.   Otherwise
we promise, both of us [liable] for the whole amount, to give to you,
making the stipulation, the penalty of the double of the said amount, 
the aforesaid [conditions] remaining as settled.  And we pledge to you
as security for the aforesaid [promises] all our goods, existing and
future... [4]
</pre>
Now, this is a very clever contract, called by scholars a
"dry exchange".  The Catholic Church forbad
the charging of interest, so a loan contract that came right out and
charged interest would be unenforceable and expose the drafters
to further Church sanctions.
But both long-distance exchange (making a trade at a distant 
market at a later date -- often via a sea voyage, thus a "wet"
exchange) and currency exchange were quite legal, enforceable,
and common.
The above contract combined these two, along with damage clauses,
in a clever way.  None of the above parties had any intention of travelling 
to Byzantium, or even outside Genoa, to perform on this contract.
Its logic can be analyzed as follows (the Holder is the creditor).
We've added the statements "in (geographic location)" , <b>security</b>,
and <b>foreclose</b> to highlight important aspects of this
contract.  The latter sells enough of the goods at auction 
to satisfy penalty (if there was not enough to satisfy the
creditors there was a bankruptcy procedure to fairly
allocate the remain security among the creditors, but this is not
shown):

<pre>	counterpartySecurity = 	pledge(allGoods(Counterparty))
	also cosignerSecurity =	pledge(allGoods(co-signer))
	then	
payment1() = 	
	when beforeTime("Kalends of September 1275")
		to Holder in Byzantium "53 hyperpers"
		terminate
payment2() = 	
	when breachedPerformance(payment1)
		to Holder in Genoa "53*11 = 583 shillings"
		terminate
payment3() = 	
	when breachedPerformance(payment2)
		to Holder in Genoa "2*583 shillings"
		terminate
payment3() = 	
	when breachedPerformance(payment3) 
		when choiceOf(Holder)
			to Holder in Genoa foreclose(counterpartySecurity, penalty)
			terminate	
		when choiceOf(Holder)
			to Holder in Genoa foreclose(cosignerSecurity, penalty)
		    	terminate
		continue
</pre>
Neither party expected payment1 to be performed.
The amounts
of hyperpers and shillings probably reflected accurately the exchange rate
between the two coins at the time -- there's no sense being
too obvious.  But it would have been far
too expensive to travel to Byzantium just to do this exchange.
So in fact both parties expected payment2, a fake
damage clause, to normally be performed.  If it wasn't,
then we have two real damage clauses -- the somewhat reasonable
"penalty of the double" and the lethal "all our goods, existing
and future".  Another interpretation of the latter clause is that
it would only  refer to a value of goods up to
the double penalty amount, but the goods could be chosen from
among all the goods of the debtor and the co-signer.
Certainly a modern court would consider the interpretation I
have placed on it in our language to be unconscionable, therefore
unenforceable.
<p>
Above the part we quoted, the contract does not
specify how much the original loan amount was -- the debtors
simply acknowledge that they have received from the creditor
"a number of Genoese deniers" and then promise other currencies
in return as quoted above.
So a Church investigator couldn't prove just from reading the
contract that any interest was charged.  As for the Genoese
judge arbitrating a dispute, he would likely be in favor of
loans at interest, and happy to wink and nod and interpret
the contract literally.
</p><p>
Modern derivatives traders do this all the time, creating <i>synthetic assets</i>
or <i>combinations</i> that mimic the financial functionality of some other
contract while avoiding its legal limitations.  Our language is ideal
for drafting and analyzing such contracts.

<br>
</p><h3>Insurance</h3>
The earliest risk-pooling insurance contracts were structured
similarly to, and enforced under the same legal principals as,
loans.   Indeed, let's start with a simple loan for
a purchase of goods with no
interest where the Holder (the creditor) can call in
the loan any time between days <b>t1</b> and <b>t2</b>:

<pre>loan(goods, principal, penalty, t1, t2) =
	counterpartySecurity = 	pledge(allGoods(Counterparty))
	with to Counterparty getTitle(goods) 
	loanPayment(principal, t1, t2)
	with when breachedPerformance(loanPayment)
		to Holder foreclose(counterpartySecurity, penalty)
loanPayment(principal, t1, t2) =
	when withinPeriod(t1,t2)
		when choiceOf(Holder)
			to Holder principal

</pre>
Let's add to our language a <b>safeArrival(goods)</b>
event --
the event that a ship carrying <b>goods</b> arrives 
safely in port and that <b>goods</b> are offloaded and accounted for.
Now by adding to this loan contract only one extra line,
whening <b>safeArrival()</b>, and slightly modifying
a few others we can transform
it into a marine  insurance 
contract.  The insured is the Holder, the insurer is the Counterparty.
For this simple version damages are paid in a fixed
amount (<b>principal</b>) if <b>safeArrival</b> does not occur:
<pre>insureGoods(goodsPremium, principal, penalty, t1, t2, goodsInsured) =
	counterpartySecurity = 	pledge(allGoods(Counterparty))
	with to Counterparty getTitle(goodsPremium) 
	insurancePayment(goodsInsured, principal, t1, t2)
	with when breachedPerformance(insurancePayment)
		to Holder foreclose(counterpartySecurity, penalty)
insurancePayment(goodsInsured, principal, t1, t2) =
	when safeArrival(goodsInsured) terminate
	when withinPeriod(t1,t2)
		when choiceOf(Holder)
			to Holder principal

</pre>

Here's an example of an early insurance contract of this kind --
again from Genoa, the birthplace of modern commercial institutions.
For the first time we see a pool of insurers -- not one but
many counterparties, each pledging their entire property
as security.  Often these were feudal lords with large landholdings,
so the value that could be brought to bear to back these insurance
contracts was vast.  This is how Lloyds Names still work
today.  Since several Names back a single contract (e.g. covering
a single shipment of goods, as here), each Name puts only a 
tiny fraction of their estate at risk in that voyage.
An insurance
exchange like Lloyds allows the agents of goods owners, shippers, and
Names to meet and mass-produce these kinds of
contracts.
<p>
</p><pre>...Geri, [son] of the late Ser Lapo 
of Florence, Simone Guascone, [9 more Names listed], each of them
[liable] for the amount written below, have acknowledged and in truth 
have declared to me, notary undersigned, as a public official [holding]
a public office, making the stipulation and receiving in the name and
stead of Federico Vivaldi, citizen of Genoa, that they have bought,
have had, and have received from him a certain amount of goods of the
said Frederico...And for these goods and in consideration of their
price each of them has promised to give and to pay to said 
Frederico or to his accredited messenger: [from] the said Geri,
150 gold florins, the said Simone, 50 florins, [100 florins
each from the other Names] within the next five months from
now.   Otherwise they have promised to give and to pay
to the said Frederico the penalty of the double of it and of the
entire amount to which and to the extent of which [this agreement]
is violated or is not observed as above, together with restitution
of all losses, unrealized profits, and expenses which might be
incurred because of it in court or outside -- the
aforesaid remaining as settled, and under hypothecation and pledge
of their goods and [the goods] of any one of them, existing
and future.

[The above is binding] with the exception and special reservation
that if the amount of goods, property, and merchandise which was
loaded or is to be loaded by Frederico Imperiale or by another in
his behalf for the account of the said Frederico Vivaldi in
Aigues-Mortes -- to be transported to Ayassoluk and Rhodes or to
either of these two localities in a certain ship...and which
departed from Aigues-Mortes or is about to depart in order
to sail to aforesaid regions -- is brought and unloaded in the said
localities of Ayasoluk and Rhodes or in either of them, in safety,
then and in such a case the present intrument is cancelled, void,
and of no value and pro rata.   And be it understood that such
a risk begins when the said ship departs and sets sail from Aigues-Mortes,
and it remains and lasts, while the captain goes, stays [in port],
sails, loads and unloads, from the said locality of Aigues-Mortres
up to the said localities of Ayassoluk and Rhodes, in whatever
manner and way he wishes, until said amount of goods, property,
and merchandise has been brought and unloaded in Ayassoluk and Rhodes
or in either of these two localities in safety, and pro rata.
Let the present instrument also be cancelled if the said
Frederico refrains from asking payments of the aforesaid amounts
of money for the space of one year after the time or the time limit
has elapsed for asking or obtaining their payment....
Done as above, September 15th, around nones. [1393 A.D.] [4] 
</pre>
Ignoring the pro rata language,
the specific definition of the risks that 
prevent generation or not of the safeArrival() event, and ignoring
the multiple Names (i.e. treating them as one
Counterparty), the contract can be modelled by the insurance 
contract we drafted above with its parameters filled in as follows,
and with Frederico Vivaldi as the insured (the Holder):
<pre>insureGoods(goodsPremium="a certain amount of goods", 
	    principal="100 fl + 50 fl + 7*100 fl",
	    penalty=2*principal,
	    t1="5 months from now",
	    t2="1 year after [legal] time limit has expired"
	    goodsInsured="that amount of goods, property, 
			and merchandise which was loaded")
</pre>
This contract was still, legally speaking, a loan.  This had
at least two interesting consequences on what we now call
the insurance premium.  Firstly, the premium was treated
as goods purchases by the insurer on credit.  Secondly,
even at this late date, contracts were coy about the
actual value of such goods. 
Leaving the value of those goods unspecified
made usury difficult to prove in this "loan".

<!-- 
Let's call <b>damages</b> the amount of damages to said goods,
and maxDamages the maximium amount payable.
Then we can draft the following contract:
-->

<br>
<h3>Rules: Logically Combined and Superimposed Events</h3>
Events in a <b>when</b> clause can be combined in logical
conditions which must evaluate to true in order to trigger
the subclause.  This can be used to model conditional clauses
in contracts, and, more broadly, procedural and substantive
rules of law.  When constructing rules we call the primitive
events <i>elements</i>.  For example, here is, roughly following
the Restatement(Second) of Contracts, a legal rule for
promissory estoppel:

<pre>when 
	"there is a promise"
 	P "has relied on that promise"
	D "should reasonably expect P would rely on that promise"  and
 	"injustice can only be remedied by enforcing the promise"
then 
	"the promise will be enforced"
else 	
	"the promise will not be enforced"

</pre>
We include a gratuitous "then" here for readability.  
Computer programmers should note that we are following a shorthand
here used by lawyers -- we write the logical phrase 
<b> (A and B and C and D)</b>
as <b>(A B C and D)</b>.  When mixing and and or, write
out the complete logic, and use parentheses where appropriate.
<p>
The rule elements, such as "there is a promise", exist in a <i>superimposed</i>
state.  By default, the logic is ignorant of the facts, and each element
is <i>genuinely at issue</i>.  As a result, "there is a promise" and 
the other elements of the above rule are both true and false, at the
same time.  (Those familiar with quantum mechanics or legal reasoning
know what I'm talking about here). In the initial state, where every 
element is genuinely at issue, nontrivial rules will always 
evaluate to both true and false.   Thus, <i>both</i> 
"promise will be enforced" and "promise will not be enforced"
clauses will be triggered.  When the clauses are incompatible,
as these appear to be by their label, it is up to the implementor 
of the clause to deal with this properly.  In this case, such a 
clause should only be treated
as <i>advisory</i> until all material elements have been decided --
i.e., they are no longer genuinely at issue, at which point
the rule can be used to make a <i>decision</i>, i.e. trigger
a single clause which takes a consistent action.  A future version
of this document will describe how to resolve elements genuinely
at issue into elements not genuinely at issue, and thus decide on
a single outcome or course of action.  It will also describe
how to deal with advisory clauses; for example, to analyze
which elements are most favorable to one outcome or another.
Finally, another future feature will include elements that 
cover a range of numerical values, rather than just true
or false, and a formalized "balancing test"
that determines outcomes based on underlying numerical estimates.

</p><h3>Property -- Estates and Future Interests</h3>
Our rule language is ideal for specifying estates and future interests in real estate deeds.  One can also apply these patterns to other kinds of property where appropriate.  Here are some examples:
<p>
<!--  TODO
	* assignment of future interests
		+ define them separately?
		+ granting vs. devising
	* RAP -- determining vesting (i.e. elimination of all contingencies)
	* I need to rewrite every contract in this article from the _obligee_ or rightholder's side, since they will normally be the ones with a bearer cert demanding payment.  Of course, obligors should keep records as per here in order to know what they are or may be obligated to perform in the future.
	* another section on writing WILLS
	* servitudes -- are these specific to the kind of property?
	* co-tenancies
-->

Lease for Term: (n.b. -- Grantor = self).  This is an old common law lease that actually transfers title for a certain period of time.
</p><pre>leaseWithTerm(Property, Lessee, Start, Term) =
	when afterTime(Start) to Lessee Property
	then when afterTime(Start+Term) to Grantor Property
</pre>
<p>
Life Estate with Reverter: (n.b. -- Grantor = self)
</p><pre>lifeEstateReverter(Property, Grantee) =
	to Grantee Property
	then when afterDeath(Grantee)
		to Grantor Property
</pre>
Assignable Reverter for Lease.  To make future interests assignable, define them separately.  Note to make the Grantor explicit.  (As usual we are looking at things from the obligor's side):
<pre>Reverter (Grantor, Grantee, Property) =
	when afterDeath(Grantee)
		to Grantor Property
</pre>
We can now redefine the Life Estate with Reverter in terms of the separately defined future interest:
<pre>lifeEstateReverter(Property, Grantee, Reverter) =
	to Grantee Property
	then Reverter(Grantor, Grantee, Property)
</pre>	
<p>
Life Estate with Remainder.  The only difference here is that the property is remaindered to a third party instead of reverting to the grantor.
</p><pre>lifeEstateRemainder(Property, Grantee, Remainderman) =
	to Grantee Property
	then when afterDeath(Grantee) to Remainderman Property
</pre>
<p>

Fee Simple Determinable.  The <b>Condition</b> can be any verifiable event or change of state of the property or its title.   A common real estate condition, for example, is "used for commercial purposes" -- i.e., a restriction that the property may not be used for commercial purposes, otherwise the grantee is penalized by losing title to the grantor.
</p><pre>feeSimpleDeterminable(Property, Grantee, Condition) =
	to Grantee Property 
	then when Condtion(Property) to Grantor Property
</pre>
<p>
Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation.  Same as Fee Simple Determinable, except the property gets remaindered to a third party instead of revertin to the grantor.
</p><pre>feeSimpleSubjectToExecutoryLimitation(Property, Grantee, Condition, Remainderman) =
	to Grantee Property 
	then when Condtion(Property) to Remainderman Property
</pre>
<p>
Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent.  Here title is not automatically transferred upon occurence of the condtion.  Instead the Grantor must do some affirmative and verifiable act (in this example "entering" the property), to reclaim the title.
</p><pre>feeSimpleSubjectToConditionSubsequent(Property, Grantee, Condition, Enters) =
	to Grantee Property 
	then when Condtion(Property)
		when Enters(Grantor, Property) to Grantor Property
</pre>


<h3>Some More Advanced Examples</h3>
In this section we will look at ways to construct multiparty
agreements, distinguish ambient from thrown events, and examine
a number of other more advanced features of or ways to use our language.
<p>
We will complete the life cycle of the American option we
drafted above by "writing" the option --
creating it from an underlying security <b>rightA</b> and selling it for 
<b>rightX.</b>
Here the Holder (same party as the Holder above, in this case the
person who will buy the written option) first verifies that the
Counterparty indeed holds the underlying security (<b>rightA</b>)  with
Broker.   The Broker is trusted by the Holder to make sure Counterparty
continues to hold the security until the option is exercised or
expired.  The contract between the Broker and Holder is
<b>escrowRight()</b>.)
</p><p>
Since Counterparty, the option writer,  is not paying anything up front for an option on <b>rightB</b>,
this right does not need to be escrowed.
</p><pre>escrowRight(right, escrow, newHolder, currentHolder,
	    newHolderReleaseEvents, currentHolderReleaseEvents) =
	to escrow right 
	then
	when (holderReleaseEvents) 
		to rightHolder right then terminate 
	when (counterpartyReleaseEvents) 
		to currentHolder right then terminate 

		
writeCallOptionAmerican(rightA, rightB, rightX, time) = 
	escrowRight(rightA, Holder, Counterparty, 
		(optionExercised), (optionExpired))
	then 
		to Counterparty callOptionAmercian(rightA, rightB, time) 
          	with to Holder rightX
</pre>

We now redraft the option itself to take advantage of the escrow.
<b>rightA</b> is transferred to Holder by the <b>throw</b> upon
excercise, or back to Counterparty if the option expires.
<pre>callOptionAmerican(escrowRight, rightB, time) = 
	when beforeTime(time) 
     		when choiceOf(Holder) 
			{ throw optionExercised at escrowRight } 
			with to Counterparty rightB 
			then terminate
	when afterTime(time) 
		throw optionExpired at escrowRight 
		then terminate
</pre>
We can think of events as coming in two kinds.  The first,
<i>ambient</i> events, occur spontaneously in the environment,
or are generated by an entity external to our specification such
as a user or a schedule.  The second,
<i>thrown</i> events, are events we explicitly throw as above.
<p>
In this manual I have expressed contract clauses in terms of rights.  
Often contract language is expressed in terms of obligations, which can
be done as a mirror image -- <b>to Holder right</b> is the same
as <b>from Counterparty obligation</b> and vice versa.   Use 
<b>from</b> to distinguish an obligation.
</p><p>



<br>
</p><h3>Hooking Up Machines</h3>
Further showing the flexibility of our language we can add sensors
and effectors, adding "smarts" to our contracts and augmenting
legal enforcement with technological constraints.
<p>
First we draft a specification
for the contract-like bevavior of a vending machine:
</p><pre>sellCandy(candyPrice = $0.90) =
	variable moneyAmount = $0.00 
	then 
		# coins also fall into a temporary till tempTill
	when (nickel)  
		add(moneyAmount, $0.05) 
	when (dime)    
		add(moneyAmount, $0.10) 
	when (quarter) 
		add(moneyAmount, $0.25)
	when (moneyReturn)  
		dropCoins(tempTill, returnTill) 
		with moneyAmount = $0.00
	when threshold(moneyAmount, candyPrice) 
		when (nickel | dime | quarter) 
			redirectNewCoinsTo(returnTill)
		also display("ready to dispense -- please select candy")
		then when (candySelection) 
			dropCandy(candyRacks, candySelection) 
			with dropCoins(tempTill, permTill)
			with moneyAmount = $0.00
	continue
</pre>




<p>
We have here introduced a new language feature, a <i>state variable</i>.
Our state variable <b>moneyAmount</b>
generates an event upon
surpassing the candy price threshold of $0.90.  Note
that nickels, dimes, etc. are actual physical objects that the sensors
(generating events "nickel", "dime", etc.) detect and treat separately -- 
they are not merely abstract amounts of money.  
</p><p>
State variables can be troublesome, and should be avoided unless
utterly necessary as here.  This one is relatively harmless 
because the coin slot tends to force the coins to come in one
at a time, so that no two clauses are trying to change the
state variable at the same time.  Even if they were, the
addition operation is what mathematicians call "commutative",
meaning it doesn't matter what order it's done in.  But if
the operation on the state variable were more complicated or
involved certain other kinds of operations, we wouldn't know
whether it was commutative.  The order in which events occured
and changed the state variable might matter very much, and we
could get into big trouble.  So avoid state variables whenever
possible.
</p><p>
To simplify things, we've left out making change -- our machine
has to have one of those signs you sometimes see,
"exact change only".   If the customer puts in a coin
that pushes the amount from, say, $.80 to $1.05 -- too
bad, the machine eats it.  If the customer puts in $0.90
(or more) and <i>then</i> adds more coins, however, the machine
automatically returns the extra coins.  The machine will 
also return whatever has been put in the till,
if the customer changes her mind and decides not
to buy the candy.  Exercise for the reader: verify for yourself
that the above behavior descriptions are correct as the
code is written.
</p><p>
<b>RedirectNewCoinsTo(returnTill)</b> causes any further 
coins to drop into the return chute instead of onto the 
sensor that triggers the above events.  The reader must
here imagine what the mechanism looks 
like, as part of the behavior
is "encoded" in its mechaninism rather than explitly
in this statement.  
</p><p>
Think of the nested contracts and rights as an upside-down
tree -- a hierarchy of nested clauses.  Events propagate 
from up from the "leaves" of the tree
towards the "root" at the top.  They are caught by the first <b>when event</b>
they encounter for that event.  In this case, once we enter the 
<b>when threshold()</b> clause,
the <b>when (nickel | dime | quarter) </b> clause overrides
the <b>when(nickel)</b> and so on clauses above them.
</p><p>
Like a perpetuity, our vending machine has no scheduled time or condition
where it stops performing -- therefore we have a <b>continue</b>
statement to overrid the implicit <b>then terminate</b> on the
last line.
</p><p>
Alas, neither I nor real world candy machine makers have any code
to solve the case where the candy gets stuck in the machine.


<!--  -->
</p><p>

The above is a transcription of machine behavior.  Now
we make it even more like a contract.
Here we incorporate
the customer and his choices, which implicitly generated
the coin events in the code above -- here the coins
are rights of the Holder.  Thinking more about the
party, rather than the machine, allows us to recognize
that at each step the customer wants feedback on
how much money they have put in, thus <b>to Counterparty 
display(moneyAmount)</b>.
This display is done by the Holder (the vending machine as an agent
of the vendor) as a right of the Counterparty (the customer).
To enable better customer choice, we add a new
construct to our language: <b>choiceOf(agent, right)</b> which
allows the customer multiple choice, based on which right
they wish to transfer to the agent's counterparty (here the
vending machine, the Holder).

</p><pre>sellCandy(candyPrice = $0.90) =
	variable moneyAmount = $0.00 
	then 
		# coins also fall into a temporary till tempTill
	when choiceOf(Counterparty, nickel) 	
		to TempTill nickel 
		then to Counterparty add(moneyAmount, $0.05) 
		then to Counterparty display(moneyAmount)
	when choiceOf(Counterparty, dime) 
		to TempTill dime
		then to Counterparty add(moneyAmount, $0.10) 
		then to Counterparty display(moneyAmount)
	when choiceOf(Counterparty, quarter) 
		to TempTill quarter 
		then to Counterparty add(moneyAmount, $0.25) 
		then to Counterparty display(moneyAmount)
	when choiceOf(Counterparty, moneyReturn)
		to Counterparty dropCoins(tempTill, returnTill)
		with moneyAmount = $0.00 
		then to Counterparty display(moneyAmount)
	when threshold(moneyAmount, candyPrice) 
	 	to Holder (nickel | dime | quarter) 
			to CounterParty redirectNewCoinsTo(returnTill)
		also display("ready to dispense -- please select candy")
		then when (candySelection) 
			to Counterparty dropCandy(candyRacks, candySelection) 
			with to PermanentTill dropCoins(TempTill)
			with moneyAmount = $0.00
	continue
</pre>





<p>
How is it that we have specified the behavior of a vending machine
in a language designed for drafting contracts?   Can nickels, dimes,
quarters, and operations like dropping coins from one till to another
be thought of as rights and obligations?  I think so.  They
are not <i>legal</i> rights and obligations, to be sure.  There
is no explicit contract between the vendor and candy machine customers,
and if their were it would probably waive liability for violating most
of the clauses in our code.   What this code describes is
the logical and typical behavior of a vending machine.  It also reifies
the implicit understanding most customers have when using a vending 
machine.  Thus it models a contract-like "meeting of the minds"
between the customer and the vendor that is mediated by the machine.
</p><p>
Here is a stab at formally describing the hypothetical <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/idea.html">"auto repo auto" </a>.
The car is controlled by a <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/proplets.html">proplet</a>
and the proplet looks to <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles.html">property titles</a> to determine ownership authority.
The proplet lets only the titled owner enter and drive
the car.  "Holder" is the bank that made the loan 
and "Counterparty" is the new owner.   As above we
ignore the car dealer; the bank originally owning
the car.  This example highlights the ability of the 
language to very succinctly describe contracts but also its
inability to describe the actual security that will enforce the 
contract.  
There is of course a lot missing here, including the items missing
from the above car loan contract.  From a smart contracts viewpoint,
the biggest thing missing
is that there is nothing to motivate the "Holder getTitle(car)"
in the last <b>when</b>, nor any way specified here to enforce it.
And of course all connection between ownership and authority
to enter, start, and drive the car is here implicit -- the actual
proplet behavior in this regard would have to account for safety, 
emergency use, etc.
</p><p>
For all that work-up, we've only actually added one clause to our
car purchase contract above.  The clause forfeits the title and is 
structured much like the damage clauses we have seen.   A 
<b>breachedPerformance()</b>
event is generated if it is detected (by the Holder, a third party
auditor, or the proplet itself) that the Countparty failed to make
a payment according to the schedule specified by <b>loan</b>.
</p><pre>loan(payment, schedule) =
	for schedule 
		when withinPeriod(schedule.next) 
			payment 
carPurchase(car, downPayment, monthlyPayment, schedule)  =
	to Counterparty getTitle(car)  with  to Holder downPayment 
	then
	to Holder loan(monthlyPayment, schedule)
	when breachedPerformance(loan) 
		to Holder getTitle(car) 
</pre>



<!-- Next we use our language to sketch out an idea for something that
I won't claim bears much resemblance to a contract at all.  It
nevertheless bears some relationship to contracts, and in
particular to property title transfers and the relationship
between a property owner and the provider of security services
to that property.  Furthermore, security services and technologies
are important for both enforcing the performance of contracts and
protecting this performance from interfering third parties.
<p>
The idea is for a security system to protect
a building.  Our hypothetical device learns who the buildings 
owner is from a public title database (see article securetitle.html).   
Lacking such
a service it could have the owner or security service reprogrammed into
it specifically by a new owner (but we don't show that design).  Our
system looks up which security service the owner has hired, and notifies
them of the security event.  If the property is sold, the
software automatically figures out, from <b>getTitle()</b>, who the 
new owner is, and
which security service is their authorized agent for handling
security events.  <b>passEvent()</b> passes on the event information
as it was received by the current event. 

<pre>
buildingSecurity = 
	when(glassBreak) { 
		aimCamera(glassBreak.location) 
		with passEvent(securityService(getTitle(property).Owner))
	}
	when(laserPerimeterBreach) { 
		aimCamera(lasterPerimeterBreach.location) 
		with passEvent(securityService(getTitle(property).Owner))
	}
</pre>

We might save precious seconds of delay in notifying security by
having a property title transfer and change of security service
generate events, then storing <b>securityService</b> as a state variable.
This way the security system doesn't have to take time to look up
the owner and then the security service during a break-in.

<pre>
buildingSecurity =
	securityService = securityService(getTitle(property).Owner)) 
	then
	when(glassBreak) { 
		aimCamera(glassBreak.location) 
        	with passEvent(securityService)
	}
	when(laserPerimeterBreach) { 
		aimCamera(lasterPerimeterBreach.location) 
		with passEvent(securityService)
	}
	when(titleTransfer OR newSecurityService) 
		securityService = securityService(getTitle(property).Owner)) 
	}
</pre>   
We design a security system in the same general way the drafters of
contracts tend to work.  First start with the most relevant and
available boilerplate.  Work out the main clauses, then fill in missing 
details, think about ways parties could cheat, and revise accordingly,
until we have a satisfactory contract -- or security system.
Clearly when used in this way, our language demonstrates its
flexibility as a tool for making high-level sketches of a wide
variety of relationships, whether mediated and constrained by
legal contract or machine or both, but we've hardly actually
implemented a real security system.  
Our language may play a high level role in coordinating and
constraining, via smart contract, the people, organizations, 
devices, and software that make up the security system.  The
security system might also be used to help enforce and protect
the smart contracts.

<h3>Technical Note-- A Computer-Readable Syntax</h3>
Here is a formal specification of the language's grammar in "Backus-Naur 
Form"(BNF).  The specification is for a planned computer-readable
version of the language and there are a few minor differences, such
as the use of brackets {} instead of tabs to denote nesting.
BNF is used to define what linguists call "context-free 
grammars".  It is also used, as here, to define the syntax of 
languages that computers can also interpret and execute.  I also
include some more discussion of the meanings of the words and
structures, especially how the computer might interpret them.
As you can see, this is an evolving language, a work in progress
with many unresolved issues.  Your suggestions for changing or adding
more kinds of contractual terms to our language are quite welcome.

<pre>agent = Holder | Counterparty
	## makes contract look different on each side
<p>

# period is the window within which the performance must be
# executed, e.g. a European option must be exercised

# periods, aftertime() or beforeTime() if it generates times)

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>



Q: There are already languages for specifying financial
contracts (e.g., [2]), what is the novelty here?
<p>
A: This the first specification language
to generalize contractual structures to any kind of exclusive
rights, not just money.  This is also the first language
that incorporates the dynamic nature of many 
contracts, (their dependence on time or events)
in a succinct, complete, and potentially executable manner. 
Surprisingly, this often makes the specification more 
not less succinct.  
</p><p>

Q: Where's the money?
</p><p>
A: This language is targeted toward an economy of distributed
software and devices performing services for each other.  A money 
economy can be constructed out of a barter economy but not vice 
versa.   Real online money is far more subtle than a mere 
shared variable (or even the specification
of "bank notes" in this language). Money is just one
kind of fungible exclusive right, and the structure
of financial contracts are generalized by converting
money terms into any fungible exclusive right.
</p><p>
Q: What assumptions are you making?
</p><p>
A: This is the most important question to ask of
any novel scheme!   I have identified at least the following:
</p><p>
(1) I'm assuming away, for the moment, issues of the protection
and enforcement of performance, which I've addressed elsewhere 
(http://szabo.vwh.best.com/ has many essays that focus
on this topic).  An eventual goal is to create protocols
to enforce the language's atoms and then to compose these
atoms maintaining the enforceability.
</p><p>
(2) Two specific enforcement assumptions -- there exists
a secure, agreed-upon time source, and the occurence of
other defined events can be agreed upon by the parties 
and/or audited by third parties.
</p><p>
(3) I am assuming some kind of atomicity for each
right atom performance -- for example, when an event 
triggers a "when", a functionPerformance in another
thread is gracefully either  rolled back or completed.
</p><p>
(4) There are only two parties to the contract, the Holder
and Counterparty.
</p><p>
(5) A contract comes in two mirror forms, one of which can
be inferred from the other.  A party always sees himself as the 
Holder.  Obligations of the Holder can always be 
expressed in and inferred from rights of the Counterparty, and
vice versa.
</p><p>
(6) I'm probably making other assumptions I haven't discovered
yet -- if you find any please let me know!
</p><p>

Q: What are some problems with this language you'd like
to see solved?
</p><p>
A: Implementations that satisfy the above assumptions
for the particular language atoms, and also for compositions
of the atoms.  (Of course, various protocols in the "financial
cryptography" field, in my own proposals, in the E language, etc. 
provide many valuable building blocks for such solutions).

<h3>Technical Notes -- Innovations in this Language</h3>
<pre>
-- Specific keywords after each instruction that distinguish it
as:
- asynchronous (also)
- asynchrononous and atomic (with)
Since this is not guarunteed atomic, is the only sure property
that both instructions must be complete before we move on?  In
this case "X with Y" is equivalent to "X also Y then".
- synchronous (then).  this also blocks all equally or lower
nested prior asynchronous calls.
-- My messages are only-way -- they have no return arguments.
(But then again, the whole point is to swap rights and perform
services defined outside the scope of the language.  Actual
"information processing" should be done using another language).
-- E allows "then" by defualt.  An asynch "also"-style call must have 
an explicit "when" to wait for its return.  In my language
these calls block at the next equally or higher nested "then"
and there are no return arguments.  E has no equivalent of 
"with", probably becomes atomicity does not have proven 
reliability and doing "with" across trust boundaries
(as usually done here)  requires a trusted escrow or,
perhaps, some very weird crypto protocol.
-- Events are asynch-callable methods that are active only
when "when" is in the "waiting" state.  (Catch can also
be in a "inactive" or "active" state).  They search for whenes
starting from the leaves of the target named clause ("throw at target").
E doesn't have anything like this, as far as I know.  Would
break capability discipline?  (But my intention is to implement
all atoms securely -- surely there is some subset of events
that can be sent securely, i.e. by never sending capabilities
in their message args?)

[5] There are many instances of deals gone sour at the last 
minute when the salesfolk check with legal and discover that 
the deal is not possible due to a clause in another contract --
for example a promise not to sell to a customer's competitors in 
an industry for a certain period of time.  Worse, such a 
conflict might not be discovered until the contraditory commitment
has been made.
