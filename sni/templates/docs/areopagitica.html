others with confidence of what they have to <span class="varspell" title="speak">speake</span>. And me perhaps each of
these dispositions, as the subject was whereon I <span class="varspell" title="entered">enter'd</span>, may have <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#othertimes" target="notes">at other
times</a> variously affected; and likely might in these <span class="varspell" title="foremost">formost</span> expressions
now also disclose which of them <span class="varspell" title="swayed">sway'd</span> most, but that the very attempt of
this <span class="varspell" title="address">addresse</span> thus made, and the thought of whom it hath recourse to, hath
got the power within me to a passion, <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> more welcome <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="incidental">incidentall</span> to a
Preface. Which though I stay not to <span class="varspell" title="confess">confesse</span> ere any <span class="varspell" title="ask">aske</span>, I shall be
<span class="varspell" title="blameless">blamelesse</span>, if <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#it" target="notes">it</a> be no other, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the joy and gratulation which <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#it2" target="notes">it</a> brings to all who wish and promote their <span class="varspell" title="Country's">Countries</span> liberty; whereof this whole
Discourse <span class="varspell" title="proposed">propos'd</span> will be a <span class="varspell" title="certain">certaine</span> testimony, if not a <span class="varspell" title="Trophy">Trophey</span>.  For this is
not the liberty which <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> can hope, that no grievance ever should arise in the
Commonwealth, that let no man in this World expect; but when complaints
are freely heard, deeply <span class="varspell" title="considered">consider'd</span> and speedily <span class="varspell" title="reformed">reform'd</span>, then is the
utmost bound of <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> liberty <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span>, that wise men <span class="varspell" title="look">looke</span> for. To which if I
now manifest by the very sound of this which I shall utter, that <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> are
already in good part <span class="varspell" title="arrived">arriv'd</span>, and yet from such a <span class="varspell" title="steep">steepe</span> disadvantage of
tyranny and superstition grounded into our principles as was <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#recovery" target="notes">beyond the
manhood of a <span class="mi">Roman</span> recovery</a>, it will <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> attributed first, as is most due, to the strong assistance of God our deliverer, next to your <span class="varspell" title="faithful">faithfull</span> guidance and undaunted <span class="varspell" title="Wisdom">Wisdome</span>, Lords and Commons of <span class="mi">England</span>. Neither is it in <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> <span class="varspell" title="esteem">esteeme</span> the diminution of his glory, when <span class="varspell" title="honorable">honourable</span> things are
spoken of good men and worthy Magistrates; which if I now <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#firstbegin" target="notes">first</a> should
begin to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, after so fair a <span class="varspell" title="progress">progresse</span> of your laudable deeds, and such a long obligement upon the whole <span class="varspell" title="Realme">Realme</span> to your indefatigable virtues, I might be
justly <span class="varspell" title="reckoned">reckn'd</span> among the tardiest, and the unwillingest of them that praise
<span class="varspell" title="ye">yee</span>. Nevertheless there being three principall things, without which all
praising is but Courtship and flattery, First, when that only is <span class="varspell" title="praised">prais'd</span> which
is solidly worth praise: next, when greatest likelihoods are brought that
such things are truly and really in those persons to whom they are <span class="varspell" title="ascribed">ascrib'd</span>,
the other, when he who praises, by <span class="varspell" title="showing">shewing</span> that such his <span class="varspell" title="actual">actuall</span> <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span>
is of whom he writes, can demonstrate that he flatters not; the former two
of these I have heretofore <span class="varspell" title="endeavored">endeavour'd</span>, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#employment" target="notes">rescuing the employment from him</a>
who went about to <span class="varspell" title="impair">impaire</span> your merits with a <span class="varspell" title="trivial">triviall</span> and malignant
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#encomium" target="notes"><span class="mi">Encomium</span></a>; the latter as belonging chiefly to mine <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> <span class="acquittal">acquittall</span>, that whom I so <span class="varspell" title="extolled">extoll'd</span> I did not flatter, hath been <span class="varspell" title="reserved">reserv'd</span> opportunely to this
occasion. For he who freely magnifies what hath been nobly done, and fears not
to declare as freely what might be done better, gives ye the best <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> of
his fidelity; and that his loyalest affection and his hope waits on your
proceedings. His highest praising is not flattery, and his plainest advice is a
<span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of praising; for though I should <span class="varspell" title="affirm">affirme</span> and hold by argument, that it
would fare better with truth, with learning, and the Commonwealth, if <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#publisht" target="notes">one
of your <span class="varspell" title="published">publisht</span> Orders</a> which I should name, were <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> in, yet at the
same time it could not but much redound to the <span class="varspell" title="luster">lustre</span> of your <span class="varspell" title="mild">milde</span> and
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#equall" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span></a> Government, when as private persons are hereby animated to <span class="varspell" title="think">thinke</span> ye
better <span class="varspell" title="pleased"><span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span></span> with <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> advice, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> other statists have been delighted
heretofore with <span class="varspell" title="public">publicke</span> flattery. And men will then see what difference there
is between the magnanimity of a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#triennial" target="notes">trienniall <span class="varspell" title="Parliament"><span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span></span></a>, and that jealous
<span class="varspell" title="haughtiness">hautinesse</span> of Prelates and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#cabin" target="notes">cabin <span class="varspell" title="Councillors">Counsellours</span></a> that <span class="varspell" title="usurped">usurpt</span> of late, when as
they shall observe <span class="varspell" title="ye">yee</span> in the <span class="varspell" title="midst">midd'st</span> of your Victories and successes more
gently brooking <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> exceptions against a voted Order, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> other Courts, which
had <span class="varspell" title="produced">produc't</span> nothing worth memory but the <span class="varspell" title="weak">weake</span> ostentation of wealth,
would have <span class="varspell" title="endured">endur'd</span> the least <span class="varspell" title="signified">signifi'd</span> dislike at any sudden Proclamation. 
If I should thus <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> presume upon the meek <span class="varspell" title="demeanor">demeanour</span> of your <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> and
gentle <span class="varspell" title="greatness">greatnesse</span>, Lords and Commons, as what your <span class="varspell" title="published">publisht</span> Order hath
directly said, that to gainsay, I might defend my <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> with ease, if any
should accuse me of being new or insolent, did they but know how much
better I find ye esteem it to imitate the old and elegant humanity of Greece,
<span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <span class="varspell" title="barbaric">barbarick</span> pride of a <span class="mi">Hunnish</span> and <span class="mi">Norwegian</span> <span class="varspell" title="stateliness">statelines</span>. And out of those ages, to whose polite wisdom and letters we <span class="varspell" title="owe">ow</span> that we are not yet <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Goths" target="notes"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Goths">Gothes</span></span> and <span class="mi">Jutlanders</span></a>, I could name <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#isocrates" target="notes" name="isocrates">him</a> who from his private house wrote that discourse to the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#athens" target="notes" name="athens"><span class="mi">Athens</span></a>, that <span class="varspell" title="persuades">perswades</span> them to change the <span class="varspell" title="form">forme</span> of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Democracy">Democraty</span></span> which was then <span class="varspell" title="established">establisht</span>. Such <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> was done in those <span class="varspell" title="days">dayes</span> to men who <span class="varspell" title="professed">profest</span> the study of <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> and eloquence, not only in their own Country, but in other Lands, that Cities and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#sr" target="notes">Siniories</a> heard them gladly, and with great respect, if they had aught in <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> to admonish the State. Thus did <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#dion" target="notes" name="dion"><span class="mi">Dion Prusæus</span></a>, a stranger and a <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> Orator <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span> the <span class="mi">Rhodians</span> against a former Edict: and I abound with other like examples, which to set <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> would be superfluous. But if from 
the industry of a life wholly dedicated to studious <span class="varspell" title="labors">labours</span>,
and those <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> endowments haply not the worst for two and fifty
degrees of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#latitude" target="notes" name="latitude">northern latitude</a>, so much must be derogated, as to count me not
<span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> to any of those who had this <span class="varspell" title="privilege">priviledge</span>, I would obtain to be thought
not so inferior, as your selves are superior to the most of them who <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span>
their <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span>: and how <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> you <span class="varspell" title="excel">excell</span> them, be <span class="varspell" title="assured">assur'd</span>, Lords and
Commons, there can no greater testimony appear, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> when your prudent
spirit acknowledges and <span class="varspell" title="obeys">obeyes</span> the voice of reason from what quarter
soever it be heard speaking; and renders ye as willing to repeal any Act of
your own setting forth, as any set forth by your Predecessors.</p>

<p>
If ye be thus <span class="varspell" title="resolved">resolv'd</span>, as it were injury to think ye were not; I know not
what should withhold me from presenting ye with fit instance wherein to
<span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> both that love of truth which ye eminently <span class="varspell" title="profess">professe</span>, and that
<span class="uprightness">uprightnesse</span> of your <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> which is not wont to be <span class="varspell" title="partial">partiall</span> to your selves;
by judging over again that <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Order2" target="notes">Order</a> which ye have <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span> <span class="mi">to regulate
Printing, That no Book, pamphlet, or paper shall be henceforth Printed,
<span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> the same be first <span class="varspell" title="approved">approv'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="licensed">licenc't</span> by such</span>, or at least one of
such as shall be thereto appointed. For that part which preserves justly
every <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#copy" target="notes">Copy</a> to <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, or provides for the poor, I touch not, only
wish they be not made pretenses to abuse and persecute honest and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#pain" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="painful">painfull</span></a>
Men, who offend not in either of these particulars. But that other clause of
Licencing Books, which we thought had <span class="varspell" title="died">dy'd</span> with his brother
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Quadragesimal" target="notes"><span class="mi">quadragesimal</span></a> and <span class="mi">matrimonial</span> when the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#prelats" target="notes" name="prelats"><span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> <span class="varspell" title="expired">expir'd</span></a>, I shall now
attend with such a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#homily" target="notes">Homily</a>, as shall lay before ye, first the inventors of it to
<span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> those whom ye will be loath to own; next what is to be thought in <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span>
of reading, what ever sort the Books be; and that this Order avails nothing to
the suppressing of scandalous, seditious, and libellous Books, which were
mainly intended to be <span class="varspell" title="suppressed">supprest</span>. Last, that it will be primely to the
discouragement of all learning, and the stop of Truth, not only by
disexercising and blunting our abilities in what we know already, but by
<span class="varspell" title="hindering">hindring</span> and cropping the discovery that might <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> yet further made both in
religious and <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> <span class="varspell" title="Wisdom">Wisdome</span>.
</p>
 
<p>
I deny not, but that it is of greatest concernment in the Church and
Commonwealth, to have a vigilant eye how <span class="varspell" title="Books">Bookes</span> <span class="varspell" title="demean">demeane</span> themselves as
well as men; and thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharpest justice on
them as malefactors: For Books are not absolutely dead things, but <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>
contain a <span class="varspell" title="potency">potencie</span> of life in them to be as active as that <span class="varspell" title="soul">soule</span> was whose
progeny they are; nay they do preserve as in a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#vial" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="vial">violl</span></a> the purest <span class="varspell" title="efficacy">efficacie</span> and
extraction of that living intellect that bred them. I know they are as lively, and
as vigorously productive, as those fabulous Dragons teeth; and being sown
up and down, may chance to spring up <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#armed" target="notes">armed men</a>. And yet on the other
hand, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="wariness">warinesse</span> be <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, as good almost kill a Man as kill a good
Book; who kills a Man kills a reasonable creature, <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> Image; but <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span>
who <span class="varspell" title="destroys">destroyes</span> a good <span class="varspell" title="Book">Booke</span>, kills reason it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>, kills the Image of God, as it
were <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#eye" target="notes">in the eye</a>. Many a man lives a burden to the Earth; but a good <span class="varspell" title="Book">Booke</span> is
the pretious life-blood of a master spirit, <span class="varspell" title="embalmed">imbalm'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="treasured">treasur'd</span> up on
purpose to a life beyond life. 'Tis true, no age can restore a life, whereof
perhaps there is no great <span class="varspell" title="loss">losse</span>; and revolutions of ages do not oft recover the
<span class="varspell" title="loss">losse</span> of a rejected truth, for the want of which whole Nations fare the worse.
We should be wary therefore what persecution we raise against the
living <span class="varspell" title="labors">labours</span> of <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> men, how we spill that <span class="varspell" title="seasoned">season'd</span> life of man
<span class="varspell" title="preserved">preserv'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="stored">stor'd</span> up in Books; since we see a <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of homicide may be
thus committed, sometimes a <span class="varspell" title="martyrdom">martyrdome</span>, and if it extend to the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#impression" target="notes">whole
impression</a>, a <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of massacre, whereof the execution ends not in the
slaying of an <span class="varspell" title="elemental">elementall</span> life, but strikes at that <span class="varspell" title="ethereal">ethereall</span> and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#fift" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="fifth">fift</span> essence</a>, the
breath of reason it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>, <span class="varspell" title="slays">slaies</span> an immortality rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a life. But lest I
should be <span class="varspell" title="condemned">condemn'd</span> of introducing licence, while I oppose Licencing, I
refuse not the <span class="varspell" title="pains">paines</span> to be so much <span class="varspell" title="Historical">Historicall</span>, as will serve to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> what
hath been done by ancient and famous Commonwealths, against this
disorder, till the very time that this project of licencing crept out of the
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Inquisition" target="notes"><span class="mi">Inquisition</span></a>, was <span class="varspell" title="catched">catcht</span> up by our Prelates, and hath caught some of our Presbyters.
</p>
 
<p>
In <span class="mi">Athens</span> where Books and Wits were ever busier <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in any other part
of <span class="mi">Greece</span>, I <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> but only two sorts of writings which the Magistrate <span class="varspell" title="cared">car'd</span>
to take notice of; those either blasphemous and <span class="varspell" title="Atheistical">Atheisticall</span>, or Libellous.
Thus the Books of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#protagoras" target="notes" name="protagoras"><span class="mi">Protagoras</span></a> were by the <span class="varspell" title="Judges">Iudges</span> of <span class="mi">Areopagus</span>
commanded to be <span class="varspell" title="burned">burnt</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> <span class="varspell" title="banished">banisht</span> the territory for a discourse
begun with his confessing not to know <span class="mi">whether there were gods, or
whether not:</span>  And against defaming, it was decreed that none should be
<span class="varspell" title="traduced">traduc'd</span> by name, as was the manner of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#comedy" target="notes"><span class="mi">Vetus Comœdia</span></a>, whereby we
may <span class="varspell" title="guess">guesse</span> how they <span class="varspell" title="censured">censur'd</span> libelling: And this course was quick enough,
as <span class="mi">Cicero</span> writes, to quell both the desperate wits of other Atheists, and the
open way of defaming, as the event <span class="varspell" title="showed">shew'd</span>. Of other sects and opinions,
though tending to <span class="varspell" title="voluptuousness">voluptuousnesse</span>, and the denying of divine providence,
they <span class="varspell" title="took">tooke</span> no heed. Therefore we do not read that either <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#epicurus" target="notes" name="epicurus"><span class="mi">Epicurus</span></a>, or that 
libertine <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Cyrene" target="notes">school of <span class="mi">Cyrene</span></a>, or what <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Cynick" target="notes">the <span class="mi">Cynick</span></a> impudence <span class="varspell" title="uttered">utter'd</span>, was ever 
<span class="varspell" title="questioned">question'd</span> by the Laws. Neither is it recorded that the writings of those old 
Comedians were <span class="varspell" title="suppressed">suppresst</span>, though the acting of them were forbid; and that

minding nought but the feats of <span class="varspell" title="War">Warre</span>. There needed no licencing of Books

could reach to:  Or if it were for his broad verses, they were not therein so

whence <span class="mi">Euripides</span> <span class="varspell" title="affirms">affirmes</span> in <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Andromache" target="notes" name="Andromache"><span class="mi">Andromache</span></a>, that their women were all

prohibited among the Greeks. The Romans also for many ages <span class="varspell" title="trained">train'd</span>

occasion to give the City a <span class="varspell" title="taste">tast</span> of their Philosophy, they were suspected
for seducers by no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> a man <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="mi">Cato</span> the Censor, who <span class="varspell" title="moved">mov'd</span> it in

withstood
him and his old <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#sabin" target="notes" name="sabin"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Sabine">Sabin</span></span></a> austerity; <span class="varspell" title="honored">honour'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="admired">admir'd</span> the men; 
and the Censor himself at last in his old age fell to the study of
that whereof before <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> was so scrupulous. And yet at the same
time <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#navius" target="notes" name="navius"><span class="mi">Nævius</span> </a>and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#plautus" target="notes" name="plautus"><span class="mi">Plautus</span></a> the first <span class="varspell" title="Latin">Latine</span> comedians had <span class="varspell" title="filled">fill'd</span> the City

<span class="varspell" title="considered">consider'd</span> there also what was to be <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> to libellous books and Authors;
for <span class="mi">Nævius</span> was quickly cast into prison for his <span class="varspell" title="unbridled">unbridl'd</span> pen, and <span class="varspell" title="released">releas'd</span>
by the <span class="mi">Tribunes</span> upon his recantation: We read also that libels were <span class="varspell" title="burned">burnt</span>,
and the makers <span class="varspell" title="punished">punisht</span> by <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#gus" target="notes"><span class="mi">Augustus</span>. </a>The like severity no doubt was
<span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> if ought were impiously <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> against their esteemed gods. Except
in these two points, how the world went in Books, the <span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span> kept no
<span class="varspell" title="reckoning">reckning</span>. And therefore <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Lucretius" target="notes" name="Lucretius"><span class="mi">Lucretius</span> </a> without impeachment versifies his Epicurism to
<span class="mi">Memmius</span>, and had the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> to be set forth the second time by <span class="mi">Cicero</span> so
great a father of the Commonwealth; although <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> disputes against that
opinion in his own writings. Nor was the <span class="varspell" title="Satirical">Satyricall</span> <span class="varspell" title="sharpness">sharpnesse</span>, or naked

And
for matters of State, the story of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#titus" target="notes" name="titus"><span class="mi">Titus Livius</span></a>, though it <span class="varspell" title="extolled">extoll'd</span> that part
which <span class="mi">Pompey</span> held, was not therefore <span class="varspell" title="suppressed">suppresst</span> by <span class="mi">Octavius Cæsar</span> of
the other Faction. But that <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#naso" target="notes" name="naso"><span class="mi">Naso</span> </a> was by him <span class="varspell" title="banished">banisht</span> in his old age, for the
wanton Poems of his youth, was but a <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> covert of State over some secret
cause: and besides, the Books were neither <span class="varspell" title="banished">banisht</span> nor <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> in. From
hence we shall meet with little else but tyranny in the Roman Empire, that we may
not <span class="varspell" title="marvel">marvell</span>, if not so often bad, as good Books were <span class="varspell" title="silenced">silenc't</span>. I shall
therefore deem to have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> large <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> in producing what among the
ancients was punishable to write, save only which, all other arguments
were free to treat on.
</p>
 
<p>
By this time the Emperors were become Christians, whose discipline in
this point I <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> to have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> more severe <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> what was formerly in
practice. The Books of those whom they took to be grand <span class="varspell" title="Heretics">Hereticks</span> were
<span class="varspell" title="examined">examin'd</span>, refuted, and <span class="varspell" title="condemned">condemn'd</span> in the general <span class="varspell" title="Councils">Councels</span>; and not till then
were prohibited, or <span class="varspell" title="burned">burnt</span> by <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> of the Emperor. As for the writings
of Heathen authors, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> they were <span class="varspell" title="plain">plaine</span> invectives against Christianity,
as those of <span class="mi">Porphyrius</span> and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Proclus" target="notes" name="Proclus"><span class="mi">Proclus</span>, </a> they met with no interdict that can be
cited, till about the year 400. in a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Councel" target="notes"><span class="mi">Carthaginian</span> <span class="varspell" title="Council">Councel</span></a>, wherein Bishops
themselves were forbid to read the Books of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Gentiles" target="notes">Gentiles</a>, but Heresies they
might read: while others long before them on the contrary <span class="varspell" title="scrupled">scrupl'd</span> more
the Books of <span class="varspell" title="Heretics">Hereticks</span>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> of Gentiles. And that the primitive <span class="varspell" title="Councils">Councels</span> and
Bishops were wont only to declare what Books were not commendable,
passing no <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span>, but leaving it to each <span class="varspell" title="one's">ones</span> conscience to read or to lay
by, till after the <span class="varspell" title="year">yeare</span> 800. is observ'd already by <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#padre" target="notes" name="padre"><span class="mi">Padre Paolo</span></a> the great
unmasker of the <span class="mi">Trentine</span> <span class="varspell" title="Council">Councel</span>. After which time the Popes of <span class="mi">Rome</span>,
engrossing what they <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span> of <span class="varspell" title="Political">Politicall</span> rule into their <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> hands, 
extended their dominion over <span class="varspell" title="men's">mens</span> eyes, as they had before over their
<span class="varspell" title="judgments">judgements</span>, burning and prohibiting to be read, what they fancied not;
yet sparing in their censures, and the Books not many which they so
 dealt with: till <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#5" target="notes"><span class="mi">Martin</span> the 5</a>. by his Bull not only prohibited, but was the
first that excommunicated the reading of <span class="varspell" title="heretical">hereticall</span> Books; for about that
time <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#wiclef" target="notes" name="wiclef"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Wycliff">Wicklef</span></span></a> and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#husse" target="notes" name="husse"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Huss">Husse</span></span></a> growing terrible, were they
who first drove the <span class="varspell" title="Papal">Papall</span> Court to a stricter policy of prohibiting. Which

those <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#author" target="notes">Catalogues, and expurging Indexes</a> that rake through the <span class="varspell" title="entrails">entralls</span> of many
an old good Author, with a violation <span class="varspell" title="worse">wors</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any could be <span class="varspell" title="offered">offer'd</span> to his

their last invention was to ordain that no Book, pamphlet, or paper should 
be Printed (as if <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi">Peter</span> had <span class="varspell" title="bequeathed">bequeath'd</span> them the keys of the <span class="varspell" title="Press">Presse</span> also out

<span class="varspell" title="limbos">limbo's</span> and new hells wherein they might include our Books also within the

But some will say, What though the inventors were bad, the thing for
all that may be good? It may be so; yet if that thing be no such
deep invention, but obvious, and <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> for any man to light on, and yet
best and wisest Commonwealths through all ages, and occasions have
foreborne to use it, and falsest seducers, and oppressors of men were
the first who <span class="varspell" title="took">tooke</span> it up, and to no other purpose but to obstruct
and hinder the first approach of Reformation; I am of those who
<span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span>, it will be a harder alchymy <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Lullius" target="notes" name="Lullius"><span class="mi">Lullius</span></a> ever knew, to
<span class="varspell" title="sublimate">sublimat</span> any good use out of such an invention. Yet this only is what
I request to gain from this reason, that it may be held a dangerous
and suspicious fruit, as certainly it deserves, for the tree that bore
it, <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> I can dissect one by one the properties it has. But I have
first to finish, as was propounded, what is to be thought in <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span>
of reading Books, what ever sort they be, and whether be more the
benefit, or the harm that thence proceeds?

Not to insist upon the examples of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#moses" target="notes" name="moses"><span class="mi">Moses, Daniel</span>, <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span>, </a>who were
<span class="varspell" title="skillful">skilfull</span> in all the learning of the <span class="varspell" title="Egyptians">Ægyptians</span>, <span class="varspell" title="Chaldeans">Caldeans</span>, and Greeks,
which could not probably be without reading their Books of all
sorts; in <span class="mi">Paul</span> especially, who thought it no defilement to insert into
holy Scripture the sentences of three Greek Poets, and one of them <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Tragedian" target="notes">a
Tragedian</a>, the question was, notwithstanding sometimes controverted
among the Primitive Doctors, but with great odds on that side which
<span class="varspell" title="affirmed">affirm'd</span> it both <span class="varspel" title="lawful">lawfull</span> and profitable, as was then evidently
<span class="varspell" title="perceived">perceiv'd</span>, when <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Julian" name="Julian" target="notes"><span class="mi">Julian</span></a> the <span class="varspell" title="Apostate">Apostat</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="subtlest">suttlest</span> enemy to our faith,
made a decree forbidding Christians the study of heathen learning:
for, said he, they wound us with our own weapons, and with our <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span>
arts and sciences they overcome us. And indeed the Christians were put
so to their shifts by this crafty means, and so much in danger to
decline into all ignorance, that the two <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Apollinarii" name="Apollinarii" target="notes"><span class="mi">Apollinarii</span></a> were fain as a
man may say, to coin all the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#science" target="notes">seven <span class="varspell" title="liberal">liberall</span> Sciences</a> out of the Bible,
reducing it into <span class="varspell" title="diverse">divers</span> forms of Orations, Poems, Dialogues, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> to
the calculating of a new Christian grammar. But, saith the Historian
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Socrates" name="Socrates" target="notes"><span class="mi">Socrates</span>, </a>The providence of God provided better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the industry of
<span class="mi">Apollinarius</span> and his son, by taking away that <span class="varspell" title="illiterate">illiterat</span> law with
the life of him who <span class="varspell" title="devised">devis'd</span> it. So great an injury they then held it
to be <span class="varspell" title="deprived">depriv'd</span> of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Hellenic">Hellenick</span></span> learning; and thought it a persecution more
undermining, and secretly decaying the Church, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the open cruelty
of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#decius" name="decius" target="notes"><span class="mi">Decius</span> or <span class="mi">Dioclesian</span></a>.
And perhaps it was the same <span class="varspell" title="politic">politick</span> drift that the <span class="varspell" title="Devil">Divell</span> <span class="varspell" title="whipped">whipt</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#jerome" target="notes"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
<span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jerome">Jerom</span></span></a> in a lenten dream, for reading <span class="mi">Cicero;</span> or else it was a
<span class="varspell" title="phantasm">fantasm</span> bred by the <span class="varspell" title="fever">feaver</span> which had then <span class="varspell" title="seized">seis'd</span> him. For had an Angel
<span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> his discipliner, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> it were for dwelling too much upon
Ciceronianisms, <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> had <span class="varspell" title="chastised">chastiz'd</span> the reading, not the vanity, it
had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> plainly <span class="varspell" title="partial">partiall</span>; first to correct him for grave <span class="mi">Cicero</span>, and not for scurrill <span class="mi">Plautus</span>, whom he confesses to have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> reading not long before; next to correct him only, and let so many more ancient Fathers wax old
in those pleasant and florid studies without the lash of such a
tutoring apparition; insomuch that <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Basil" target="notes" name="Basil"><span class="mi">Basil</span></a> teaches how some good use may
be made of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Margites" target="notes" name="Margites"><span class="mi">Margites</span></a>, a <span class="varspell" title="sportful">sportfull</span> Poem, not now extant, writ by <span class="mi">Homer</span>; and why not then of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Morgante" target="notes" name="Morgante"><span class="mi">Morgante</span></a>, an Italian <span class="varspell" title="Romance">Romanze</span> much to the same purpose.
But if it be agreed we shall be <span class="varspell" title="tried">try'd</span> by visions, there is a
vision recorded by <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Eusebius" target="notes" name="Eusebius"><span class="mi">Eusebius</span></a> far ancienter <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> this tale of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jerome">Jerom</span></span> to the Nun <span class="mi">Eustochium</span>, and besides has nothing of a <span class="varspell" title="fever">feavor</span> in it. <span class="mi">Dionysius Alexandrinus</span> was about the year 240, a person of great name in the Church for piety and learning, who had wont to avail himself
much against <span class="varspell" title="heretics">hereticks</span> by being conversant in their Books; <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> a
certain Presbyter laid it scrupulously to his conscience, how he durst
venture <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> among those defiling volumes. The worthy man loath
to give offence fell into a new debate with <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> what was to be
thought; when suddenly a vision sent from God, it is his own Epistle
that so <span class="varspell" title="avers">averrs</span> it, <span class="varspell" title="confirmed">confirm'd</span> him in these words: Read any books
what ever come to thy hands, for thou art sufficient both to judge
aright, and to examine each matter. To this revelation he assented the
sooner, as he confesses, because it was <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#answerable" target="notes">answerable</a> to that of the
Apostle to the Thessalonians, Prove all things, hold fast that which
is good. And he might have added another remarkable saying of the same
Author; To the pure, all things are <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#pure" target="notes">pure</a>, not only meats and drinks,
but all <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of knowledge whether of good or <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>; the knowledge
cannot defile, nor consequently the books, if the will and
conscience be not <span class="varspell" title="defiled">defil'd</span>.
For books are as meats and viands are; some of good, some of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>
substance; and yet God in that <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#unapocryphal" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="unapocryphal">unapocryphall</span> vision</a>, said without
exception, Rise <span class="mi">Peter</span>, kill and eat, leaving the choice to each <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span>
discretion. Wholesome meats to a vitiated <span class="varspell" title="stomach">stomack</span> differ little or
nothing from unwholesome; and best books to a naughty mind are not
unappliable to occasions of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>. Bad meats will scarce breed good
nourishment in the healthiest concoction; but herein the difference is
of bad books, that they to a discreet and judicious Reader serve in
many respects to discover, to confute, to forewarn, and to illustrate.
<span class="varspell" title="Whereof">Wherof</span> what better <span class="varspell" title="witness">witnes</span> can ye expect I should produce, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> one
of your own now sitting in <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, the chief of learned men
reputed in this land, Mr. <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Selden" target="notes" name="Selden"><span class="mi">Selden</span></a>, whose volume of <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> national
laws proves, not only by great <span class="varspell" title="authorities">autorities</span> brought together, but by
exquisite reasons and theorems almost mathematically demonstrative,
that all opinions, yea errors, known, read, and collated, are of
main service <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> assistance toward the speedy attainment of what is
truest. I conceive therefore, that when God did enlarge the <span class="varspell" title="universall">universall</span>
diet of <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> body, saving ever the rules of temperance, he then also,
as before, left arbitrary the <span class="varspell" title="dieting">dyeting</span> and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#repasting" target="notes">repasting of our minds</a>; as
wherein every mature man might have to exercise his <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> leading
capacity.
How great a <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> is temperance, how much of moment through the
whole life of man? yet God <span class="varspell" title="commits">committs</span> the managing so great a trust,
without particular Law or prescription, wholly to the <span class="varspell" title="demeanor">demeanour</span> of
every grown man. And therefore when he himself <span class="varspell" title="tabled">tabl'd</span> the Jews from
heaven, that Omer which was every <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> daily portion of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Manna" target="notes">Manna</a>, is
computed to have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> might have well <span class="varspell" title="sufficed">suffic'd</span> the heartiest
feeder thrice as many meals. For those actions which enter into a man,
rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> issue out of him, and therefore <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#defile" target="notes">defile not</a>, God uses not
to <span class="varspell" title="captivate">captivat</span> under a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#perpetuall" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="perpetual">perpetuall</span> childhood</a> of prescription, but trusts
him with the gift of reason to be his own chooser; there were but
little work left for preaching, if law and compulsion should grow so
fast upon those things which <span class="varspell" title="heretofore">hertofore</span> were <span class="varspell" title="governed">govern'd</span> only by
exhortation. <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Salomon" target="notes" name="Salomon"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Solomon">Salomon</span></span></a> informs us that much reading is a <span class="varspell" title="weariness">wearines</span> to
the flesh; but neither he, nor other <span class="varspell" title="inspired">inspir'd</span> author tells us that such,
or such reading is <span class="varspel" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span>: yet certainly had God thought good to
limit us herein, it had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> much more expedient to have told us
what was <span class="varspel" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> what was wearisome. As for the burning of those
Ephesian books by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Paul's">Pauls</span></span> converts, tis <span class="varspell" title="replied">reply'd</span> the books were
<span class="varspell" title="magic">magick</span>, the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Syriac" target="notes" name="Syriac"><span class="varspell" title="Syriac">Syriack</span></a> so renders them. It was a <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> act, a voluntary
act, and leaves us to a voluntary imitation: the men in remorse
<span class="varspell" title="burned">burnt</span> those books which were their own; the <span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span> by this example
is not appointed; these men <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#p" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="practiced">practiz'd</span></a> the books, another might perhaps
have read them in some sort usefully.
<a name="goodandevil">Good</a> and <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> we know in the field of this World grow up together
almost inseparably; and the knowledge of good is so <span class="varspell" title="involved">involv'd</span> and
interwoven with the knowledge of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, and in so many cunning
resemblances hardly to be <span class="varspell" title="discerned">discern'd</span>, that those confused seeds which
were <span class="varspell" title="imposed">impos'd</span> on <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Psyche" target="notes" name="Psyche"><span class="mi">Psyche</span></a> as an incessant <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> to cull out, and
sort asunder, were not more <span class="varspell" title="intermixed">intermixt</span>. It was from out the <span class="varspell" title="rind">rinde</span> of
one apple tasted, that the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#knowledge" target="notes" name="apple">knowledge</a> of good and <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> as two twins cleaving together <span class="varspell" title="leaped">leapt</span> forth into the World. And perhaps this is
that doom which <span class="mi">Adam</span> fell into of knowing good and <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, that is to
say of knowing good by <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>. As therefore the state of man now is;
what <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> can there be to choose, what continence to <span class="varspell" title="forbear">forbeare</span> without
the knowledge of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>? He that can apprehend and consider vice with
all her baits and seeming pleasures, and yet abstain, and yet
distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly better, he is the true
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#wayfaring" target="notes">wayfaring</a> Christian.
I cannot praise a <a name="fugitive">fugitive</a> and <span class="varspell" title="cloistered">cloister'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, <span class="varspell" title="unexercised">unexercis'd</span> <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> <span class="varspell" title="unbreathed">unbreath'd</span>, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but
slinks out of the race, where that <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#garland" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="immortal">immortall</span> garland</a> is to be run
for, not without dust and heat. Assuredly we bring not innocence
into the world, we bring impurity much rather: that which purifies
us is <span class="varspell" title="trial">triall</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="trial">triall</span> is by what is contrary. That <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> therefore
which is but a youngling in the contemplation of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, and knows not
the utmost that vice promises to her followers, and rejects it, is but
a blank <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, not a pure; her <span class="varspell" title="whiteness">whitenesse</span> is but an <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ex" target="notes"><span class="varspel" title="excremental">excrementall</span></a>
<span class="varspell" title="whiteness">whitenesse</span>; Which was the reason why our sage and serious Poet <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Spencer" target="notes" name="Spencer"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Spenser">Spencer</span></span></a>,
whom I dare be known to think a better teacher <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Scotus" target="notes"><span class="mi">Scotus</span></a> or <span class="mi">Aquinas</span>, describing true temperance under the person of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Guyon">Guion</span></span>, brings him in with his palmer through the cave of Mammon, and the <span class="varspel" title="bower">bowr</span> of earthly <span class="varspell" title="bliss">blisse</span> that he might see and know, and yet abstain. Since therefore
the knowledge and <span class="varspell" title="survey">survay</span> of vice is in this world so necessary to
the constituting of human <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, and the scanning of error to the
confirmation of truth, how can we more safely, and with <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> danger
scout into the regions of sin and falsity <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by reading all manner
of <span class="varspell" title="tracates">tractats</span>, and hearing all manner of reason? And this is the benefit
which may be had of books promiscuously read.
But of the harm that may result hence three kinds are usually
<span class="varspell" title="reckoned">reckn'd</span>. First, is <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span> the infection that may spread; but then all
human learning and <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span> in religious points must remove out
of the world, yea the Bible it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>; for that oftimes relates
blasphemy not nicely, it describes the <span class="varspell" title="carnal">carnall</span> sense of wicked men
not unelegantly, it brings in holiest men passionately murmuring
against providence through all the arguments of <span class="mi">Epicurus</span>: in other
great disputes it answers dubiously and darkly to the common reader:
And ask a Talmudist what ails the modesty of his marginal Keri, that
<span class="mi">Moses</span> and all the Prophets cannot <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span> him to pronounce the
<span class="varspell" title="textual">textuall</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Chetiv" target="notes" name="Chetiv">Chetiv</a>. For these causes we all know the Bible it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> put by
the Papist into the first rank of prohibited books. The ancientest
Fathers must be next <span class="varspell" title="removed">remov'd</span>, as <span class="mi">Clement</span> of <span class="mi">Alexandria</span>, and that
<span class="mi">Eusebian</span> book of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ev" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="Evangelic">Evangelick</span> preparation</a>, transmitting our ears
through a hoard of heathenish obscenities to receive the Gospel. Who
finds not that <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ir" target="notes"><span class="mi">Irenæus, Epiphanius, <span class="varspell" title="Jerome">Jerom</span></span></a>, and others discover
more heresies <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> they well confute, and that oft for <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> which is
the truer opinion.
Nor boots it to say for these, and all the heathen Writers of
greatest infection, if it must be thought so, with whom is bound up
the life of human learning, that they writ in an unknown tongue, so
long as we are sure those languages are known as well to the worst
of men, who are both most able, and most diligent to instill the poison
they suck, first into the Courts of Princes, acquainting them with the
choicest delights, and criticisms of sin. As perhaps did that <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Petronius" target="notes" name="Petronius"><span class="mi">Petronius</span></a>
whom <span class="mi">Nero</span> <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> his <span class="mi">Arbiter</span>, the Master of his revels; and that
notorious ribald of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Arezzo" target="notes" name="Arezzo"><span class="mi">Arezzo</span></a>, dreaded, and yet dear to the Italian
Courtiers. I name not him for <span class="varspell" title="posterity's">posterities</span> sake, whom <span class="mi">Harry</span> the 8. <span class="varspell" title="named">nam'd</span>
in merriment his <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#hell" target="notes">Vicar of hell</a>. By which compendious way all the
contagion that <span class="varspell" title="foreign">foreine</span> books can infuse, will find a passage to the
people <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> easier and shorter <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> an Indian voyage, though it could be
<span class="varspell" title="sailed">sail'd</span> either by the North of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Cataio" target="notes"><span class="mi">Cataio</span></a> Eastward, or of <span class="mi">Canada</span>
Westward, while our Spanish licencing gags the English <span class="varspell" title="Press">Presse</span> never
so severely.
But on the other side that infection which is from books of
<span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span> in Religion, is more <span class="varspell" title="doubtful">doubtfull</span> and dangerous to the
learned, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to the ignorant; and yet those books must be permitted
<span class="varspell" title="untouched">untoucht</span> by the licencer. It will be hard to instance where any
ignorant man hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> ever <span class="varspell" title="seduced">seduc't</span> by <span class="varspell" title="Papistical">Papisticall</span> book in English,
<span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> it were commended and expounded to him by some of that
Clergy: and indeed all such <span class="varspell" title="tractates">tractats</span> whether false or true are as
the <span class="varspell" title="Prophecy">Prophesie</span> of <span class="mi">Isaiah</span> was to the <span class="mi">Eunuch</span>, not to be <span class="mi">understood without a</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#guide" target="notes"><span class="mi">guide</span></a>. But of our Priests and Doctors how many have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> corrupted by studying the comments of Jesuits and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Sorbonists" target="notes" name="Sorbonists"><span class="mi">Sorbonists</span></a>, and how fast
they could transfuse that corruption into the people, our experience
is both late and sad. It is not forgot, since the acute and distinct
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Arminius" target="notes"><span class="mi">Arminius</span></a> was perverted <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> by the perusing of a <span class="varspell" title="nameless">namelesse</span>
discourse <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> at <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Delft">Delf</span></span>, which at first he took in hand to confute.
Seeing therefore that those books, <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> those in great abundance
which are likeliest to taint both life and doctrine, cannot be
<span class="varspell" title="suppressed">suppresst</span> without the fall of learning, and of all ability in
disputation, and that these books of either sort are most and
soonest catching to the learned, from whom to the common people
whatever is <span class="varspell" title="heretical">hereticall</span> or dissolute may quickly be <span class="varspell" title="conveyed">convey'd</span>, and that
<span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> manners are as perfectly <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnt</span> without books a thousand other
ways which cannot be <span class="varspell" title="stopped">stopt</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> doctrine not with books can
propagate, except a teacher guide, which he might also <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> without
writing, and so beyond prohibiting, I am not able to unfold, how
this cautelous enterprise of licencing can be exempted from the number of vain
and impossible attempts. And he who were pleasantly <span class="varspell" title="disposed">dispos'd</span> could not
well avoid to <span class="varspell" title="liken">lik'n</span> it to the exploit of that gallant man who
thought to pound up the crows by shutting his Parkgate.
Besides another inconvenience, if learned men be the first receivers
out of books <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> <span class="varspell" title="dispreaders">dispredders</span> both of vice and error, how shall the
licencers themselves be confided in, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> we can <span class="varspell" title="confer">conferr</span> upon them,
or they assume to themselves above all others in the Land, the grace
of infallibility, and <span class="varspell" title="uncorruptedness">uncorruptednesse</span>? And again if it be true, that
a wise man like a good refiner can gather gold out of the
drossiest volume, and that a fool will be a fool with the best book,
yea or without book, there is no reason that we should deprive a
wise man of any advantage to his <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span>, while we seek to restrain
from a fool, that which being <span class="varspell" title="restrained">restrain'd</span> will be no hindrance to his
folly. For if there should be so much <span class="varspell" title="exactness">exactnesse</span> always <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> to keep
that from him which is unfit for his reading, we should in the
<span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Aristotle" target="notes" name="Aristotle"><span class="mi">Aristotle</span></a> not only, but of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Salomon2" target="notes" name="Salomon2"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Solomon">Salomon</span></span></a>, and of our <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Saviour" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span></a>, not <span class="varspell" title="vouchsafe">voutsafe</span> him good precepts, and by consequence not willingly admit him to good books; as being certain that a wise man will make better
use of an idle pamphlet, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a fool will do of sacred Scripture.
'Tis next <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alleg'd</span> we must not expose ourselves to temptations
without necessity, and next to that, not <span class="varspell" title="employ">imploy</span> our time in vain
things. To both these objections one answer will serve, out of the
grounds already laid, that to all men such books are not
temptations, nor vanities; but <span class="varspell" title="useful">usefull</span> drugs and <span class="varspell" title="materials">materialls</span> wherewith to
temper and compose effective and strong <span class="varspell" title="medicines">med'cins</span>, which <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> life
cannot <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#want" target="notes">want</a>. The rest, as children and childish men, who have not
the art to <span class="varspell" title="qualify">qualifie</span> and prepare these working <span class="varspell" title="minerals">mineralls</span>, well may be
exhorted to forbear, but <span class="varspell" title="hindered">hinder'd</span> forcibly they cannot be by all the
licencing that Sainted Inquisition could ever yet contrive; which is
what I <span class="varspell" title="promised">promis'd</span> to deliver next, That this order of licencing conduces
nothing to the end for which it was <span class="varspell" title="framed">fram'd</span>; and hath almost
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#prevented" target="notes">prevented</a> me by being clear already while thus much hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span>
explaining. See the ingenuity of Truth, who when she gets a free
and willing hand, opens herself faster <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the pace of method and
<span class="varspell" title="discourse">discours</span> can overtake her.
It was the task which I began with, To <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> that no Nation, or
well instituted State, if they <span class="varspell" title="valued">valu'd</span> books at all, did ever use
this way of licencing; and it might be <span class="varspell" title="answered">answer'd</span>, that this is a
piece of prudence lately <span class="varspell" title="discovered">discover'd</span>. To which I return, that as it was
a thing slight and obvious to think on, so if it had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> difficult to
<span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> out, there wanted not among them long since, who suggested such
a <span class="varspell" title="course">cours</span>; which they not following, leave us a pattern of their
<span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span>, that it was not the not knowing, but the not approving, which
was the cause of their not using it.
<span class="mi">Plato</span>, a man of high <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>, indeed, but least of all for his <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#plato" target="notes" name="plato">Commonwealth</a>, in the book of his laws, which no City ever yet
<span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span>, fed his <span class="varspell" title="fancy">fancie</span> with making many edicts to his <span class="varspell" title="airy">ayrie</span>
Burgomasters, which they who otherwise admire him, wish had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> rather
buried and <span class="varspell" title="excused">excus'd</span> in the <span class="mi">genial</span> cups of an <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Academic">Academick</span></span> night-sitting. By which laws he seems to <span class="varspell" title="tolerate">tolerat</span> no kind of learning, but by unalterable decree, consisting most of <span class="varspell" title="practical">practicall</span> traditions, to the attainment
whereof a Library of smaller bulk <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> his own dialogues would be
abundant. And <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#there" target="notes">there also enacts</a> that no Poet should so much as read
to any <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> man, what he had <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span>, <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> the Judges and
Law-keepers had seen it, and <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> it: But that <span class="mi">Plato</span> meant this Law
peculiarly to that Commonwealth which he had <span class="varspell" title="imagined">imagin'd</span>, and to no
other, is evident. Why was he not else a Law-giver to himself, but a
transgressor, and to be <span class="varspell" title="expelled">expell'd</span> by his own <span class="varspell" title="Magistrates">Magistrats</span>; both for
the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#made" target="notes">wanton epigrams and dialogues</a> which he made, and his <span class="varspell" title="perpetual">perpetuall</span>
reading of <span class="mi">Sophron Mimus</span> and <span class="mi">Aristophanes</span>, books of grossest infamy, and also for commending the latter of them, though he were the
malicious libeller of his chief <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#friends" target="notes">friends</a>, to be read by the Tyrant
<span class="mi">Dionysius</span>, who had little need of such trash to spend his time on? But
that he knew this licencing of Poems had reference and dependence to
many other <span class="varspell" title="provisos">proviso's</span> there set down in his fancied republic, which in
this world could have no place: and so neither he himself, nor any
<span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span>, or City ever imitated that <span class="varspell" title="course">cours</span>, which <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> apart from
those other <span class="varspell" title="collateral">collaterall</span> injunctions, must needs be vain and
<span class="varspell" title="fruitless">fruitlesse</span>. For if they fell upon one kind of strictnesse, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span>
their care were <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> to <span class="varspell" title="regulate">regulat</span> all other things of like <span class="varspell" title="aptness">aptnes</span> to
corrupt the mind, that single <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">endeavour</span> they knew would be but a
fond <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span>; to shut and <span class="varspell" title="fortify">fortifie</span> one gate against corruption, and be
necessitated to leave others round about wide open.
If we think to <span class="varspell" title="regulate" id="censor">regulat</span> Printing, thereby to rectifie manners, we
must <span class="varspell" title="regulate">regulat</span> all recreations and pastimes, all that is delightful
to man. No <span class="varspell" title="music">musick</span> must be heard, no song be set or sung, but what is
grave and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Dorick" target="notes" name="Dorick"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Doric">Dorick</span></span></a>. There must be licencing dancers, that no gesture,
motion, or deportment be taught our youth but what by their
allowance shall be thought honest; for such <span class="mi">Plato</span> was provided of;
It will ask more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the work of twenty licencers to <span class="varspell" title="examine">examin</span> all
the lutes, the violins, and the <span class="varspell" title="guitars">ghittarrs</span> in every house; they must
not be <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span> to prattle as they <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, but must be <span class="varspell" title="licenced">licenc'd</span> what
they may say. And who shall silence all the airs and <span class="varspell" title="madrigals">madrigalls</span>, that
whisper <span class="varspell" title="softness">softnes</span> in chambers? The Windows also, and the <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Balconies">Balcone's</span></span> must
be thought on, there are shrewd books, with dangerous <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#front" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="Frontispieces">Frontispices</span></a>
set to sale; who shall prohibit them, shall twenty licencers? The
villages also must have their visitors to <span class="varspell" title="inquire">enquire</span> what lectures the
bagpipe and the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#reb" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="rebeck">rebbeck</span></a> reads <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> to the <span class="varspell" title="balladry">ballatry</span>, and the <span class="varspell" title="gammut">gammuth</span> of
every <span class="mi">municipal</span> <span class="varspell" title="fiddler">fidler</span>, for these are the <span class="varspell" title="Countryman's">Countrymans</span> <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Arcadias">Arcadia's</span></span> and his <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#monte" target="notes"><span class="mi">Monte Mayors</span></a>.
Next, what more <span class="varspell" title="National">Nationall</span> corruption, for which England hears ill
abroad, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span> gluttony; who shall be the rectors of our daily
rioting? and what shall be done to inhibit the multitudes that
frequent those houses where <span class="varspell" title="drunkenness">drunk'nes</span> is sold and <span class="varspell" title="harbored">harbour'd</span>? Our
garments also should be <span class="varspell" title="referred">referr'd</span> to the licencing of some more sober
work-masters to see them cut into a <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> wanton garb. Who shall
<span class="varspell" title="regulate">regulat</span> all the <span class="varspell" title="mixed">mixt</span> conversation of our youth, male and female
together, as is the fashion of this Country, who shall still appoint
what shall be <span class="varspell" title="discoursed">discours'd</span>, what <span class="varspell" title="presumed">presum'd</span>, and no <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span>? Lastly, who
shall forbid and <span class="varspell" title="separate">separat</span> all idle resort, all <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> company? These
things will be, and must be; but how they shall be lest hurtfull,
how lest enticing, herein consists the grave and governing wisdom
of a State.
To sequester out of the world into <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#polities" target="notes"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Atlantic">Atlantick</span></span> and <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Utopian">Eutopian</span></span> polities</a>
which never can be drawn into use, will not mend our condition; but to
ordain wisely as in this world of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, in the <span class="varspell" title="midst">midd'st</span> whereof God
hath <span class="varspell" title="placed">plac't</span> us unavoidably. Nor is it <span class="mi">Plato's</span> licencing of books
will <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> this, which necessarily pulls along with it so many other
kinds of licencing, as will make us all both ridiculous and weary, and
yet <span class="varspell" title="frustrate">frustrat</span>; but those <span class="varspell" title="unwritten">unwritt'n</span>, or at least unconstraining laws
of <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span> education, religious and <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> nurture, which <span class="mi">Plato</span>
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#mentions" target="notes">there mentions</a>, as the bonds and ligaments of the Commonwealth, the
pillars and the sustainers of every <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> Statute; these they be
which will bear chief sway in such matters as these, when all
licencing will be easily eluded. Impunity and <span class="varspell" title="remissness">remissenes</span>, for certain
are the bane of a Commonwealth, but here the great art <span class="varspell" title="lies">lyes</span> to
discern in what the law is to bid restraint and punishment, and in
what things <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> only is to work.
If every action which is good, or <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> in man at ripe years, were to
be under pittance, and prescription, and compulsion, what were <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>
but a name, what praise could be then due to well-doing, what <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#gramercy" target="notes">gramercy</a>
to be sober, just or continent? many there be that complain of <span class="varspell" title="divine">divin</span>
Providence for suffering <span class="mi">Adam</span> to transgresse, foolish tongues! when God
gave him reason, he gave him freedom to choose, for <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#reason" target="notes" name="reason">reason is but
choosing;</a> he had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> else a <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> <span class="varspell" title="mere">artificiall</span> <span class="mi">Adam</span>, such an <span class="mi">Adam</span> as he is <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#motions" target="notes">in the motions</a>. We our selves esteem not of that obedience, or
love, or gift, which is of force: God therefore left him free, set
before him a provoking object, ever almost in his eyes herein
consisted his merit, herein the right of his reward, the praise of his
abstinence. Wherefore did he <span class="varspell" title="create">creat</span> passions within us, pleasures
round about us, but that these rightly <span class="varspell" title="tempered">temper'd</span> are the very
ingredients of <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertu</span>?
They are not <span class="varspell" title="skillful">skilfull</span> considerers of human things, who <span class="varspell" title="imagine">imagin</span> to
remove sin by removing the matter of sin; for, besides that it is a
huge heap increasing under the very act of diminishing, though some
part of it may for a time be withdrawn from some persons, it cannot
from all, in such a <span class="varspell" title="universal">universall</span> thing as books are; and when this is
done, yet the sin remains entire. Though ye take from a covetous man
all his treasure, he has yet one <span class="varspell" title="jewel">jewell</span> left, ye cannot bereave him
of his <span class="varspell" title="covetousness">covetousnesse</span>. Banish all objects of lust, shut up all youth
into the severest discipline that can be <span class="varspell" title="exercised">exercis'd</span> in any hermitage,
ye cannot make them chaste, that came not thither so: such great
care and wisdom is <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> to the right managing of this point.
Suppose we could <span class="varspell" title="expel">expell</span> sin by this means; look how much we thus
<span class="varspell" title="expel">expell</span> of sin, so much we <span class="varspell" title="expel">expell</span> of <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>: for the matter of them
both is the same; remove that, and ye remove them both alike.
This justifies the high providence of God, who though he command
us temperance, justice, continence, yet <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#powrs" target="notes"><span class="varspell" title="pours">powrs</span></a> out before us <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> to a
<span class="varspell" title="profuseness">profusenes</span> all desirable things, and gives us minds that can
wander beyond all limit and satiety. Why should we then affect a
rigour contrary to the manner of God and of nature, by abridging or
scanting those means, which books freely permitted are, both to the
<span class="varspell" title="trial">triall</span> of <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> and the exercise of truth. It would be better done to
learn that the law must needs be frivolous which goes to restrain
things, uncertainly and yet equally working to good, and to <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>. And
were I the chooser, a dram of well-doing should be <span class="varspell" title="preferred">preferr'd</span> before
many times as much the forcible hindrance of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>-doing. For God
sure esteems the growth and compleating of one <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span> person, more
<span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the restraint of ten <span class="varspell" title="vicious">vitious</span>.
And albeit whatever thing we hear or see, sitting, walking,
travelling, or conversing may be fitly <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> our book, and is of the
same effect that writings are, yet grant the thing to be prohibited
were only books, it appears that this order hitherto is far
insufficient to the end which it intends. Do we not see, not once or
oftner, but weekly <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#libell" target="notes">that <span class="varspell" title="continued">continu'd</span> Court-<span class="varspell" title="libel">libell</span></a> against the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>
and City, Printed, as the wet sheets can <span class="varspell" title="witness">witnes</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="dispersed">dispers't</span>
among us, for all that licencing can <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>. yet this is the prime service
a man would think, wherein this order should give proof of it self.
If it were executed, <span class="varspell" title="you'll">you'l</span> say. But certain, if execution be <span class="varspell" title="remiss">remisse</span>
or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter
and in other books? If then the order shall not be vain and <span class="varspell" title="frustrate">frustrat</span>,
behold a new <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span>, Lords and Commons, ye must repeal and proscribe
all scandalous and <span class="varspell" title="unlicensed">unlicenc't</span> books already printed and <span class="varspell" title="divulged">divulg'd</span>;
after ye have drawn them up into a list, that all may know which are
<span class="varspell" title="condemned">condemn'd</span>, and which not; and ordain that no <span class="varspell" title="foreign">forrein</span> books be
<span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliver'd</span> out of custody, till they have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> read over. This office
will require the whole time of not a few overseers, and those no
vulgar men. There be also books which are partly <span class="varspell" title="useful">usefull</span> and excellent,
partly culpable and pernicious; this work will ask as many more
officials, to make expurgations, and expunctions, that the Commonwealth
of Learning be not <span class="varspell" title="damnified">damnify'd</span>. In fine, when the multitude of books
<span class="varspell" title="increase">encrease</span> upon their hands, ye must be fain to catalogue all those
Printers who are found frequently offending, and forbidd the
importation of their whole suspected <span class="mi">typography</span>. In a word, that
this your order may be exact, and not deficient, ye must reform it
perfectly according to the model of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#Trent" target="notes" name="Trent"><span class="mi">Trent</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#sevil" target="notes" name="Seville"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Seville">Sevil</span></span></a>, which I know ye
<span class="varspell" title="abhor">abhorre</span> to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>.
Yet though ye should condescend to this, which God forbid, the order
still would be but <span class="varspell" title="fruitless">fruitlesse</span> and defective to that end whereto ye
meant it. If to prevent sects and schisms, who is so unread or so
<span class="varspell" title="uncatechised">uncatechis'd</span> in story, that hath not heard of many sects refusing
books as a hindrance, and preserving their doctrine <span class="varspell" title="unmixed">unmixt</span> for many
ages, only by <span class="varspell" title="unwritten">unwritt'n</span> traditions. The Christian faith, for that
was once a schism, is not unknown to have spread all over <span class="mi">Asia</span>, ere
any Gospel or Epistle was seen in writing. If the amendment of manners
be <span class="varspell" title="aimed">aym'd</span> at, look into Italy and Spain, whether those places be one
scruple the better, the honester, the wiser, the chaster, since all
the <span class="varspell" title="inquistional">inquisitionall</span> rigor that hath been executed upon books.
</p>

<p>
Another reason, whereby to make it plain that this order will <span class="varspell" title="miss">misse</span>
the end it seeks, consider by the quality which ought to be in every
licencer. It cannot be <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> but that he who is made judge to sit
upon the birth, or death of books whether they may be wafted into this
world, or not, had need to be a man above the common measure, both
studious, learned, and judicious; there may be else no mean mistakes
in the censure of what is passable or not; which is also no mean
injury. If he be of such worth as <span class="varspell" title="behooves">behoovs</span> him, there cannot be a
more tedious and unpleasing Journey-work, a greater <span class="varspell" title="loss">losse</span> of time
levied upon his head, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to be made the <span class="varspell" title="perpetual">perpetuall</span> reader of unchosen
books and pamphlets, oftimes huge volumes. There is no book that is
acceptable <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> at certain seasons; but to be <span class="varspell" title="enjoined">enjoyn'd</span> the reading
of that at all times, and in a hand <span class="varspell" title="scarce">scars</span> legible, whereof three pages
would not down at any time in the fairest Print, is an imposition I
cannot <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> how he that values time, and his own studies, or is
but of a sensible <span class="varspell" title="nostril">nostrill</span> should be able to endure. In this one thing
I crave leave of the present licencers to be <span class="varspell" title="pardoned">pardon'd</span> for so thinking:
who <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtlesse</span> took this office up, looking on it through their
obedience to the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, whose command perhaps made all things
seem <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> and unlaborious to them; but that this short <span class="varspell" title="trial">triall</span> hath
wearied them out already, their own expressions and excuses to them
who make so many journeys to <span class="varspell" title="solicit">sollicit</span> their licence, are testimony
<span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>. Seeing therefore those who now <span class="varspell" title="possess">possesse</span> the <span class="varspell" title="employment">imployment</span>, by all
evident signs wish themselves well <span class="varspell" title="rid">ridd</span> of it, and that no man of
worth, none that is not a plain unthrift of his own hours is ever
likely to succeed them, except he mean to put himself to the salary of
a <span class="varspell" title="Press">Presse</span>-corrector, we may easily foresee what kind of licencers we are
to expect hereafter, either ignorant, imperious, and <span class="varspell" title="remiss">remisse</span>, or basely
pecuniary. This is what I had to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span>, wherein this order cannot
conduce to that end, whereof it bears the intention.
</p>
<p>
I lastly proceed from the no good it can do, to the manifest hurt it
causes, in being first the greatest discouragement and affront, that
can be <span class="varspell" title="offered">offer'd</span> to learning and to learned men.  It was the complaint and lamentation of <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>, upon every least
breath of a motion to remove <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#pluralities" target="notes" name="pluralities">pluralities</a>, and distribute more
equally Church <span class="varspell" title="revenues">revennu's</span>, that then all learning would be for ever
<span class="varspell" title="dashed">dasht</span> and <span class="varspell" title="discouraged">discourag'd</span>. But as for that opinion, I never found cause
to think that the tenth part of learning stood or fell with the
Clergy: nor could I ever but hold it for a sordid and unworthy
speech of any Churchman who had a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#competency" target="notes" name="competency">competency </a>left him. If therefore ye
be loath to dishearten utterly and discontent, not the mercenary
crew of false pretenders to learning, but the free and ingenuous
sort of such as evidently were born to study, and love <span class="varspell" title="learning">lerning</span> for
it self, not for lucre, or any other end, but the service of God and of
truth, and perhaps that lasting fame and perpetuity of praise which
God and good men have consented shall be the reward of those whose

far to distrust the <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> the honesty of one who hath but a
common repute in learning, and never yet offended, as not to count him
fit to print his mind without a tutor and examiner, lest he should
drop a <span class="varspell" title="schism">scism</span>, or something 
of corruption, is the greatest displeasure
and indignity to a free and knowing spirit that can be put upon him.  
What advantage is it to be a man over it is to be a boy at school, if we
 have only <span class="varspell" title="escaped">scapt</span> the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ferular" target="notes" name="ferular">ferular</a>, to come under the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#fescu" target="notes" name="fescu"><span class="varspell" title="fescue">fescu</span></a> of an <span class="mi">Imprimatur</span>? if serious and <span class="varspell" title="elaborate">elaborat</span> writings, as if they were no more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <span class="varspell" title="theme">theam</span> of a Grammar lad under his Pedagogue must not be
<span class="varspell" title="uttered">utter'd</span> without the cursory eyes of a temporizing and extemporizing
licencer.  He who is not trusted with his own actions, his drift not
being known to be <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, and standing to the hazard of law and penalty,
has no great argument to think himself reputed in the Commonwealth
<span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> he was born, for other <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a fool or a <span class="varspell" title="foreigner">foreiner</span>. When a
man writes to the world, he summons up all his reason and deliberation
to assist him; he searches, <span class="varspell" title="meditates">meditats</span>, is industrious, and likely
consults and <span class="varspell" title="confers">conferrs</span> with his judicious friends; after all which
done he takes himself to be <span class="varspell" title="informed">inform'd</span> in what he writes, as well as any

fidelity and <span class="varspell" title="ripeness">ripenesse</span>, no years, no industry, no former proof of his
abilities can bring him to that state of maturity, as not to be
still mistrusted and suspected, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> he carry all his <span class="varspell" title="considerate">considerat</span>

the hasty view of an <span class="varspell" title="unleisured">unleasur'd</span> licencer, perhaps much his younger,
perhaps far his <span class="varspell" title="inferior">inferiour</span> in <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span>, perhaps one who never knew the
<span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> of book-writing, and if he be not <span class="varspell" title="repulsed">repulst</span>, or slighted, must
appear in Print like a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#punie" target="notes" name="punie"><span class="varspell" title="puny">punie</span></a> with his guardian, and his <span class="varspell" title="censor's">censors</span> hand
on the back of his title to be his <span class="varspell" title="bail">bayl</span> and surety, that he is no idiot,
or seducer, it cannot be but a <span class="varspell" title="dishonor">dishonour</span> and derogation to the author,
to the book, to the <span class="varspell" title="privilege">priviledge</span> and dignity of Learning.  And what if the author shall be one so copious of <span class="varspell" title="fancy">fancie</span>, as to have many things well worth the adding, come into his mind after licencing, while the book is yet under the <span class="varspell" title="Press">Presse</span>, which not seldom
<span class="varspell" title="happens">happ'ns</span> to the best and diligentest writers; and that perhaps a
dozen times in one book. The Printer dares not go beyond his
<span class="varspell" title="licensed">licenc't</span> copy; so often then must the author trudge to his
<span class="varspell" title="leave">leav</span>-giver, that those his new insertions may be <span class="varspell" title="viewed">viewd</span>; and many a
jaunt will be made, ere that licencer, for it must be the same man,
can either be found, or found at leisure; mean while either the <span class="varspell" title="Press">Presse</span>
must stand still, which is no small damage, or the author loose his
accuratest thoughts, <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> send the book forth <span class="varspell" title="worse">wors</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> he had made
it, which to a diligent writer is the greatest melancholy and vexation
that can befall.  And how can a man teach with <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>, which is the life of
teaching, how can he be a Doctor in his book as he ought to be, or
else had better be silent, whenas all he teaches, all he delivers,
is but under the tuition, under the correction of his <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#patriarchal" target="notes" name="patriarchal">patriarchal</a>
licencer to blot or alter what precisely accords not with the
hidebound humor which he calls his <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span>. When every acute reader
upon the first sight of a <span class="varspell" title="pedantic">pedantick</span> licence, will be ready with these
like words to ding the book a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#coit" target="notes" name="coit"><span class="varspell" title="coit's">coits</span></a> distance from him, I hate a
pupil teacher, I endure not an <span class="varspell" title="instructor">instructer</span> that comes to me under the
wardship of an overseeing fist. I know nothing of the licencer, but
that I have his own hand here for his arrogance; who shall warrant
me his <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span>? The State Sir, replies the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#stationer" target="notes" name="stationer">Stationer</a>, but has a

they may be <span class="varspell" title="mistaken">mistak'n</span> in the choice of a licencer, as easily as this
licencer may be <span class="varspell" title="mistaken">mistak'n</span> in an author: This is some common <span class="varspell" title="stuff">stuffe</span>:
and he might <span class="varspell" title="add">adde</span> from Sir <span class="mi">Francis Bacon</span>, That <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#bacon" target="notes" name="bacon"><span class="mi">such <span class="varspell" title="authorized">authoriz'd</span> books
are but the language of the times</span></a>. For though a licencer should <span class="varspell" title="happen">happ'n</span>
to be judicious more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> ordnary, which will be a great jeopardy
of the next succession, yet his very office and his commission <span class="varspell" title="enjoins">enjoyns</span>
him to let <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> nothing but what is vulgarly <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span> already.  Nay, which is more lamentable, if the work of any deceased author,
though never so famous in his life time, and even to this day, come to
their hands for licence to be Printed, or Reprinted, if there be found
in his book one sentence of a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ventrous" target="notes" name="ventrous"><span class="varspell" title="venturous">ventrous</span></a> edge, <span class="varspell" title="uttered">utter'd</span> in the height of
zeal, and who knows whether it might not be the <span class="varspell" title="dictate">dictat</span> of a divine
Spirit, yet not suiting with every low decrepit humor of their own,
though it were <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#knox" target="notes" name="knox"><span class="mi">Knox</span></a> himself, the Reformer of a Kingdom that spake it,
they will not pardon him <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#dash" target="notes" name="dash">their dash</a>: the sense of that great man shall
to all posterity be lost, for the <span class="varspell" title="fearfulness">fearfulnesse</span> or the presumptuous
<span class="varspell" title="rashness">rashnesse</span> of a perfunctory licencer. And to what an author this
violence hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> lately done, and in <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#coke" target="notes" name="coke">what book of greatest consequence</a>
to be faithfully <span class="varspell" title="published">publisht</span>, I could now instance, but shall forbear
till a more convenient season.  Yet if these things be not resented seriously and timely by them who
have the remedy in their power, but that such <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#moulds" target="notes" name="moulds">iron <span class="varspell" title="molds">moulds</span></a> as these
shall have <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> to <span class="varspell" title="gnaw">knaw</span> out the choicest <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#periods" target="notes" name="periods">periods</a> of exquisitest
books, and to commit such a treacherous fraud against the orphan
remainders of worthiest men after death, the more sorrow will belong
to that <span class="varspell" title="hapless">haples</span> race of men, whose misfortune it is to have
understanding. Henceforth let no man care to learn, or care to be more
<span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> worldly wise; for certainly in higher matters to be ignorant
and <span class="varspell" title="slothful">slothfull</span>, to be a common <span class="varspell" title="steadfast">stedfast</span> dunce will be the only
pleasant life, and only in request.

<p>
And as it is a particular disesteem of every knowing person alive,
and most injurious to the <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> <span class="varspell" title="labors">labours</span> and monuments of the dead,
so to me it seems an undervaluing and vilifying of the whole Nation. I
cannot set so light by all the invention, the art, the wit, the
grave and solid <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> which is in England, as that it can be
comprehended in any twenty capacities how good soever, much <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span>
that it should not <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> except their superintendence be over it,
except it be sifted and <span class="varspell" title="strained">strain'd</span> with their strainers, that it
should be <span class="varspell" title="uncurrent">uncurrant</span> without their <span class="varspell" title="manual">manuall</span> stamp. <a name="truthaswares">Truth and
understanding</a> are not such wares as to be <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#monopoly" target="notes" name="monopoly"><span class="varspell" title="monopolized">monopoliz'd</span></a> and traded in by
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#tickets" target="notes" name="tickets">tickets and statutes</a>, and standards. We must not think to make a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#staple" target="notes" name="staple">staple
commodity</a> of all the knowledge in the Land, to mark and licence it
like our broad <span class="varspell" title="cloth">cloath</span>, and our <span class="varspell" title="wool">wooll</span> packs. What is it but a servitude like
that <span class="varspell" title="imposed">impos'd</span> by the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#philistines" target="notes" name="philistines"><span class="varspell" title="Philistines">Philistims</span></a>, not to be <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> the <span class="varspell" title="sharpening">sharpning</span> of
our own axes and coulters, but we must repair from all quarters to
twenty licencing forges.   Had any one <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> and <span class="varspell" title="divulged">divulg'd</span> erroneous
things <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> scandalous to honest life, misusing and forfeiting the
esteem had of his reason among men, if after conviction this only
censure were <span class="varspell" title="adjudged">adjudg'd</span> him, that he should never henceforth write, but
what were first <span class="varspell" title="examined">examin'd</span> by an appointed officer, whose hand should be
<span class="varspell" title="annexed">annext</span> to <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> his credit for him, that now he might be safely read,
it could not be apprehended <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a <span class="varspell" title="disgraceful">disgracefull</span> punishment. Whence
to include the whole Nation, and those that never yet thus offended,
under such a diffident and suspectfull prohibition, may plainly be
understood what a disparagement it is. So much the more, when  <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#debtors" target="notes" name="debtors">
<span class="varspell" title="debtors">dettors</span> and delinquents</a> may walk abroad without a keeper, but
unoffensive books must not <span class="varspell" title="stir">stirre</span> forth without a visible <span class="varspell" title="jailor">jaylor</span> in
<span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> title.  Nor is it to the common people <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a reproach; for if we be so
jealous over them, as that we dare not trust them with an English
pamphlet, what <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> we but censure them for a giddy, <span class="varspell" title="vicious">
vitious</span>, and
ungrounded people; in such a sick and weak estate of faith and
discretion, as to be able to take nothing down but through the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#pipe" target="notes" name="pipe">pipe</a> of
a licencer. That this is care or love of them, we cannot pretend,
whenas in those Popish places where the Laity are most hated and
<span class="varspell" title="despised">dispis'd</span> the same <span class="varspell" title="strictness">strictnes</span> is <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> over them. Wisdom we cannot call
it, because it stops but one breach of licence, nor that neither;
whenas those corruptions which it seeks to prevent, break in faster
at other <span class="varspell" title="doors">dores</span> which cannot be shut.
</p>

<p>
And in conclusion it reflects to the disrepute of our Ministers
also, of whose <span class="varspell" title="labors">labours</span> we should hope better, and of the <span class="varspell" title="proficiency">proficiencie</span>
which <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> flock reaps by them, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that after all this light of the
Gospel which is, and is to be, and all this <span class="varspell" title="continual">continuall</span> preaching,
they should be still frequented with such an <span class="varspell" title="unprincipled">unprincipl'd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="unedified">unedify'd</span>,
and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#laick" target="notes" name="laick"><span class="varspell" title="laic">laick</span> rabble</a>, as that the <span class="varspell" title="whiff">whiffe</span> of every new pamphlet should
stagger them out of their catechism, and Christian walking. This may
have much reason to discourage the Ministers when such a low <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#conceit" target="notes" name="conceit">conceit</a>
is had of all their exhortations, and the benefiting of their hearers,
as that they are not thought fit to be <span class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span> loose to three sheets of
paper without a licencer, that all the Sermons, all the Lectures
<span class="varspell" title="preached">preacht</span>, printed, vented in such numbers, and such volumes, as have
now wellnigh made all other books unsalable, should not be armor
<span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> against one single <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#enchiridion" target="notes" name="enchiridion"><span class="mi">enchiridion</span></a>, without <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#angelo" target="notes" name="angelo">the castle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
<span class="mi">Angelo</span></a> of an <span class="mi">Imprimatur</span>.
</p>

<p>
And lest <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> should <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span> ye, Lords and Commons, that these
arguments of <span class="varspell" title="learned">lerned</span> <span class="varspell" title="men's">mens</span> discouragement at this your order, are
<span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> flourishes, and not <span class="varspell" title="real">reall</span>, I could recount what I have seen and
heard in other Countries, where this kind of inquisition tyrannizes;
when I have sat among their <span class="varspell" title="learned">lerned</span> men, for that honor I had, and
<span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> counted happy to be born in such a place of <span class="mi">Philosophic</span>
freedom, as they <span class="varspell" title="supposed">suppos'd</span> England was, while <span class="varspell" title="themselves">themselvs</span> did nothing
but bemoan the <span class="varspell" title="servile">servil</span> condition into which <span class="varspell" title="learning">lerning</span> amongst them
was brought; that this was it which had <span class="varspell" title="damped">dampt</span> the glory of Italian
wits; that nothing had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> there <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> now these many years but
flattery and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#fustian" target="notes" name="fustian">fustian</a>. There it was that I found and visited the famous
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#galileo" target="notes" name="galileo"><span class="mi">Galileo</span></a> grown old, a <span class="varspell" title="prisoner">prisner</span> to the Inquisition, for thinking in
Astronomy otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#licencers" target="notes">Franciscan and Dominican licencers</a>
thought.  And though I knew that England then was groaning loudest under the
<span class="varspell" title="Prelatical">Prelaticall</span> <span class="varspell" title="yoke">yoak</span>, <span class="varspell" title="nevertheless">neverthelesse</span> I took it as a pledge of future
<span class="varspell" title="happiness">happines</span>, that other Nations were so <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span> of her liberty. Yet
was it beyond my hope that those Worthies were then breathing in her
air, who should be her leaders to such a deliverance, as shall never
be <span class="varspell" title="forgotten">forgott'n</span> by any revolution of time that this world hath to finish.
When that was once begun, it was as little in my fear, that what words
of complaint I heard among <span class="varspell" title="learned">lerned</span> men of other parts <span class="varspell" title="uttered">utter'd</span>
against the Inquisition, the same I should hear by as <span class="varspell" title="learned">lerned</span> men at
home <span class="varspell" title="uttered">utterd</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#parlament" target="notes" name="parlament">in time of <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span></a> against an order of licencing;
and that so generally, that when I had <span class="varspell" title="disclosed">disclos'd</span> my self a companion of
their discontent, I might say, if without envy, that he whom an honest
<span class="mi">quæstorship</span> had <span class="varspell" title="endeared">indear'd</span> to the <span class="mi">Sicilians</span>, was not more by them
<span class="varspell" title="importuned">importun'd</span> against <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#verres" target="notes" name="verres"><span class="mi">Verres</span></a>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <span class="varspell" title="favorable">favourable</span> opinion which I had
among many who <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> ye, and are known and respected by ye, loaded me
with entreaties and <span class="varspell" title="persuasions">perswasions</span>, that I would not despair to lay
together that which just reason should bring into my mind, toward
the removal of an undeserved thraldom upon <span class="varspell" title="learning">lerning</span>. That this is
not therefore <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#fancie" target="notes" name="fancie">the <span class="varspell" title="disburdening">disburdning</span> of a particular <span class="varspell" title="fancy">fancie</span></a>, but the common
grievance of all those who had <span class="varspell" title="prepared">prepar'd</span> their minds and studies
above the vulgar pitch to advance truth in others, and from others
to entertain it, thus much may <span class="varspell" title="satisfy">satisfie</span>.  And in their name I shall for neither friend nor foe conceal what
the <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> murmur is; that if it come to inquisitioning again, and
licencing, and that we are so timorous of our <span class="varspell" title="selves">selvs</span>, and so suspicious
of all men, as to fear each book, and the shaking of every leaf, before
we know what the contents are, if some who but of late were little
better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="silenced">silenc't</span> from preaching, shall come now to silence us
from reading, except what they please, it cannot be <span class="varspell" title="guessed">guest</span> what is
intended by <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> but a second tyranny over learning: and will soon put
it out of <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span> that <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#bishops" target="notes" name="bishops">Bishops and Presbyters</a> are the same to us
both name and thing. That those <span class="varspell" title="evils">evills</span> of Prelaty which before from

people, will now light wholly upon learning, is not obscure to us:
whenas now the Pastor of a small unlearned Parish, on the sudden
shall be exalted Archbishop over a large <span class="varspell" title="diocese">dioces</span> of books, and yet not
remove, but keep his other cure too, a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#mystical" target="notes" name="mystical"><span class="varspell" title="mystical">mysticall</span></a> pluralist. He <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#down" target="notes">who
but of late <span class="varspell" title="cried">cry'd</span> down</a> the sole ordination of every novice <span class="varspell" title="Bachelor">Batchelor</span> of
Art, and <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> sole jurisdiction over the simplest Parishioner, shall
now at home in his <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> chair assume both these over worthiest
and excellentest books and ablest authors that write them.  This is not, <span class="varspell" title="Ye">Yee</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#covnants" target="notes" name="covnants"><span class="varspell" title="Covenants">Covnants</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#protestations" target="notes" name="protestations">Protestations</a> that we have made, this is not to put down Prelaty, this is but to <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#chop" target="notes" name="chop">chop</a> an Episcopacy;
this is but to translate the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#palace" target="notes" name="palace">Palace <span class="mi">Metropolitan</span></a> from one kind of
dominion into another, this is but an old <span class="varspell" title="canonical">canonicall</span> sleight of
<span class="mi">commuting</span> our penance. To startle thus betimes at a <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> <span class="varspell" title="unlicensed">unlicenc't</span>
pamphlet will after a while be afraid of every <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#conventicle" target="notes">conventicle</a>, and a
while after will make a conventicle of every Christian meeting. But
I am certain that a State <span class="varspell" title="governed">govern'd</span> by the rules of justice and
fortitude, or a Church built and founded upon the rock of faith and
true knowledge, cannot be so pusillanimous. While things are yet not
constituted in Religion, that freedom of writing should be
<span class="varspell" title="restrained">restrain'd</span> by a discipline imitated from the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnt</span> by
them from the Inquisition to shut us up all again into the <span class="varspell" title="breast">brest</span>
of a licencer, must needs give cause of doubt and discouragement to
all learned and religious men.  Who cannot but discern the <span class="varspell" title="fineness">finenes</span> of this politic drift, and who
are the contrivers; that while Bishops were to be baited down, then
all Presses might be open; it was the <span class="varspell" title="people's">peoples</span> birthright and
<span class="varspell" title="privilege">priviledge</span> in time of <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, it was the breaking forth of light.
But now the Bishops abrogated and voided out of the Church, as if our
Reformation sought no more, but to make room for others into their
seats under another name, the <span class="varspell" title="Episcopal">Episcopall</span> arts begin to bud again, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#oyle" target="notes" name="oyle">the
cruse of truth must run no more <span class="varspell" title="oil">oyle</span></a>, liberty of Printing must be
<span class="varspell" title="enthralled">enthrall'd</span> again under a <span class="varspell" title="Prelatical">Prelaticall</span> commission of twenty, the
privilege of the people <span class="varspell" title="nullified">nullify'd</span>, and which is <span class="varspell" title="worse">wors</span>, the freedom of
learning must groan again, and to her old fetters; all this the
<span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> yet sitting. Although their own late arguments and defences
against the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> might remember them that this obstructing
violence meets for the most part with an event utterly opposite to the
end which it drives at: instead of suppressing <a name="sectsandschisms">sects</a> and schisms, it
raises them and invests them with a reputation: <span class="mi">The punishing of wits
<span class="varspell" title="enhances">enhaunces</span> their <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span></span>, saith the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#spark" target="notes" name="spark">Vicount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi">Albans</span></a>, <span class="mi">and a
<span class="varspell" title="forbidden">forbidd'n</span> writing is thought to be a certain spark of truth that flies
up in the faces of them who <span class="varspell" title="seek">seeke</span> to tread it out</span>. This order
therefore may prove a nursing mother to sects, but I shall easily
<span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> how it will be a step-dame to Truth: and first by <span class="varspell" title="disenabling">disinabling</span> us
to the maintenance of what is known already.
</p>

<p>
Well knows he who uses to consider, that our faith and knowledge
thrives by exercise, as well as our limbs and complexion. Truth is
<span class="varspell" title="compared">compar'd</span> in Scripture to <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#scripture" target="notes" name="scripture">a streaming fountain</a>; if her waters flow
not in a <span class="varspell" title="perpetual">perpetuall</span> progression, they <span class="varspell" title="sicken">sick'n</span> into a muddy pool of conformity
and tradition. A man may be a <span class="varspell" title="heretic">heretick</span> in the truth; and if he
<span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> things only because his Pastor <span class="varspell" title="says">sayes</span> so, or the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#assembly" target="notes" name="assembly">Assembly</a> so
<span class="varspell" title="determines">determins</span>, without knowing other reason, though his belief be true,
yet the very truth he holds, becomes his <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span>.  There is not any burden that <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> would gladlier post off to another, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the charge and care of their Religion. There be, who knows not
that there be of Protestants and professors who live and <span class="varspell" title="die">dye</span> in as
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#arrant" target="notes" name="arrant">arrant</a> an <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#implicit" target="notes" name="implicit">implicit faith</a>, as any lay Papist of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#loretto" target="notes" name="loretto">Loretto</a>. A wealthy
man addicted to his pleasure and to his profits, finds Religion to be
a <span class="varspell" title="traffic">traffick</span> so <span class="varspell" title="entangled">entangl'd</span>, and of so many piddling accounts, that of
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#mysteries" target="notes" name="mysteries">all mysteries</a> he cannot skill to keep a stock going upon that trade.
What should he <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>? fain he would have the name to be religious, fain
he would bear up with his <span class="varspell" title="neighbors">neighbours</span> in that. What does he
therefore, but <span class="varspell" title="resolves">resolvs</span> to give over <span class="varspell" title="toiling">toyling</span>, and to find himself out
<span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#factor" target="notes" name="factor">factor</a>, to whose care and credit he may commit the whole managing
of his religious affairs; <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> Divine of note and estimation that must
be. To him he adheres, resigns the whole ware-house of his religion,
with all the locks and <span class="varspell" title="keys">keyes</span> into his custody; and indeed makes the
very person of that man his religion; esteems his associating with him
a sufficient evidence and commendatory of his own piety. So that a man
may say his religion is now no more within himself, but is <span class="varspell" title="become">becom</span> a
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#movable" target="notes" name="movable"><span class="varspell" title="dividual">dividuall</span> movable</a>, and goes and comes <span class="varspell" title="near">neer</span> him, according as that
good man frequents the house. He entertains him, gives him gifts,
feasts him, lodges him; his religion comes home at night, <span class="varspell" title="prays">praies</span>, is
liberally <span class="varspell" title="supped">supt</span>, and sumptuously laid to sleep, rises, is saluted,
and after the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#malmsey" target="notes" name="malmsey">malmsey</a>, or some well <span class="varspell" title="spiced">spic't</span> <span class="varspell" title="brewage">bruage</span>, and better
breakfasted <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> he whose morning appetite would have gladly fed on
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#betheny" target="notes" name="betheny">green figs</a> between <span class="mi">Betheny</span> and <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jerusalem">Ierusalem</span></span>, his Religion walks abroad at
eight, and <span class="varspell" title="leaves">leavs</span> his kind entertainer in the shop trading all day
without his religion.
</p>

<p>
Another sort there be who when they hear that all things shall be
<span class="varspell" title="ordered">order'd</span>, all things regulated and <span class="varspell" title="settled">setl'd</span>, nothing <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> but what
passes through the custom-house of certain <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#publicans" target="notes" name="publicans">Publicans</a> that have the
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ton" target="notes" name="ton"><span class="varspell" title="tunnaging">tunaging</span> and the poundaging</a> of all free <span class="varspell" title="spoken">spok'n</span> truth, will <span class="varspell" title="straight">strait</span>

religion ye please; there be delights, there be recreations and
jolly pastimes that will fetch the day about from sun to sun, and rock
the tedious year as in a delightfull dream. What need they torture
their heads with that which others have <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> so strictly, and so
unalterably into their own <span class="varspell" title="purveying">pourveying</span>. These are the fruits which a
dull ease and cessation of our knowledge will bring forth among the people.
How goodly, and how to be <span class="varspell" title="wished">wisht</span> were such an obedient unanimity as
this, what a fine conformity would it starch us all into? <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtles</span>
a stanch and solid <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of frame-work, as any January could freeze
together.
</p>

<p>
Nor much better will be the consequence <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> among the clergy
<span class="varspell" title="themselves">themselvs</span>; it is no new thing never heard of before, for a
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#parochial" target="notes" name="parochial"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="parochial">parochiall</span></span></a> Minister, who has his reward, and is at his <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#hercules" target="notes" name="hercules"><span class="mi">Hercules</span> pillars</a>

forming and transforming, <span class="varspell" title="joining">joyning</span> and <span class="varspell" title="disjoining">dis-joyning</span> variously a little
book-craft, and two hours meditation might furnish him unspeakably to
the performance of more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a weekly charge of sermoning: not to

<span class="mi">synopses</span>, and other loitering gear</a>. But as for the multitude of
Sermons ready printed and <span class="varspell" title="piled">pil'd</span> up, on every text that is not
difficult, our London trading <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#thomas" target="notes" name="thomas"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi">Thomas</span> in his vestry</a>, and <span class="varspell" title="add">adde</span> to

need fear of Pulpit provision, having where so plenteously to
refresh his <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#magazin" target="notes" name="magazin"><span class="varspell" title="magazine">magazin</span></a>. But if his rear and flanks be not <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#impaled" target="notes" name="impaled"><span class="varspell" title="impaled">impal'd</span></a>, if
his back <span class="varspell" title="door">dore</span> be not <span class="varspell" title="secured">secur'd</span> by the rigid licencer, but that a bold
book may now and then issue forth, and give the assault to some of
his old collections in their trenches, it will concern him then to
keep waking, to stand in watch, to set good guards and <span class="varspell" title="sentinels">sentinells</span> about
his <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span> opinions, to walk the round and counter-round with his
fellow inspectors, fearing lest any of his flock be <span class="varspell" title="seduced">seduc't</span>, who
also then would be better instructed, better <span class="varspell" title="exercised">exercis'd</span> and
<span class="varspell" title="disciplined">disciplin'd</span>. And God send that the fear of this diligence which
must then be <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not make us affect the <span class="varspell" title="laziness">lazines</span> of a licencing
Church.
</p>

<p>
For if we be sure we are in the right, and <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not hold the truth
guiltily, which becomes not, if we our selves condemn not our own
weak and frivolous teaching, and the people for an untaught and
irreligious gadding rout, what can be more fair, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> when a man
judicious, learned, and of a conscience, for aught we know, as good as
theirs that taught us what we know, shall not privily from house to
house, which is more dangerous, but openly by writing publish to the
world what his opinion is, what his reasons, and wherefore that
which is now thought cannot be sound. <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#christus" target="notes" name="christus">Christ <span class="varspell" title="urged">urg'd</span> it</a> as wherewith
to <span class="varspell" title="justify">justifie</span> himself, that he <span class="varspell" title="preached">preacht</span> in <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span>; yet writing is more
<span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> preaching; and more <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> to refutation, if need be,
there being so many whose <span class="varspell" title="business">businesse</span> and profession <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> it is, to be
the champions of Truth; which if they neglect, what can be imputed but
their sloth, or unability?
</p>

<p>
Thus much we are <span class="varspell" title="hindered">hinder'd</span> and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#disinured" target="notes" name="disinured"><span class="varspell" title="disinured">dis-inur'd</span></a> by this <span class="varspell" title="course">cours</span> of licencing
toward the true knowledge of what we seem to know. For how much it
hurts and hinders the licencers themselves in the calling of their
<span class="varspell" title="Ministry">Ministery</span>, more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any secular employment, if they will discharge
that office as they ought, so that of necessity they must neglect
either the one duty or the other, I insist not, because it is a
particular, but leave it to their own conscience, how they will decide
it there.
</p>

<p>
There is yet behind of what I <span class="varspell" title="purposed">purpos'd</span> to lay open, the incredible
<span class="varspell" title="loss">losse</span>, and detriment that this plot of licencing puts us to, more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>
if <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> enemy at sea should stop up all our <span class="varspell" title="havens">hav'ns</span> and ports, and
creeks, it hinders and retards the importation of our richest
<span class="varspell" title="Merchandise">Marchandize</span>, Truth: nay it was first <span class="varspell" title="established">establisht</span> and put in
practice by Antichristian malice and mystery on set purpose to
extinguish, if it were possible, the light of Reformation, and to
settle <span class="varspell" title="falsehood">falshood</span>; little differing from that <span class="varspell" title="policy">policie</span> wherewith the Turk
upholds his <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#koran" target="notes" name="koran"><span class="mi">Alcoran</span></a>, by the prohibition of Printing. 'Tis not
<span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span>, but gladly <span class="varspell" title="confessed">confest</span>, we are to send our thanks and vows to
<span class="varspell" title="heaven">heav'n</span> louder <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> most of Nations, for that great measure of truth
which we enjoy, especially in those main points between us and the
Pope, with his <span class="varspell" title="appurtenances">appertinences</span> the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>: but he who thinks we are to
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#but" target="notes" name="but">pitch our tent here</a>, and have <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span> the utmost prospect of
reformation, that the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#darkly" target="notes" name="darkly"><span class="varspell" title="mortal">mortall</span> <span class="varspell" title="glass">glasse</span></a> wherein we contemplate, can <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span>
us, till we come to <span class="mi">beatific</span> vision, that man by this very opinion
declares, that he is yet <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> short of Truth.
</p>

<p>
Truth indeed came once into the world with <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#perfecti" target="notes" name="perfecti">her divine Master</a>, and
was a perfect shape most glorious to look on: but when he ascended,
and his Apostles after Him were laid asleep, then <span class="varspell" title="straight">strait</span> arose a
wicked race of deceivers, who as that story goes of the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#hewed" target="notes" name="hewed"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Egyptian">Ægyptian</span>
Typhon</span></a> with his conspirators, how they dealt with the good <span class="mi">Osiris</span>,
took the virgin Truth, <span class="varspell" title="hewed">hewd</span> her lovely form into a thousand <span class="varspell" title="pieces">peeces</span>,
and <span class="varspell" title="scattered">scatter'd</span> them to the four winds. From that time ever since, the
sad friends of Truth, such as durst appear, imitating the <span class="varspell" title="careful">carefull</span>
search that <span class="mi">Isis</span> made for the <span class="varspell" title="mangled">mangl'd</span> body of <span class="mi">Osiris</span>, went up and down
gathering up limb by limb still as they could find them. We have
not yet found them all, Lords and Commons, nor ever shall <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, till her
Masters second <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span>; he shall bring together every joynt and
member, and shall mould them into an immortall feature of lovelines
and perfection. Suffer not these licencing prohibitions to stand at
every place of opportunity forbidding and disturbing them that
continue seeking, that continue to do our obsequies to the torn body
of our <span class="varspell" title="martyred">martyr'd</span> Saint.  We boast our light; but if we look not wisely on the Sun it self, it smites us into <span class="varspell" title="darkness">darknes</span>. Who can discern those planets that are oft
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#combust" target="notes" name="combust"><span class="mi">Combust</span></a>, and those stars of brightest magnitude that rise and set with
the Sun, <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> the opposite motion of their orbs bring them to such
a place in the firmament, where they may be seen <span class="varspell" title="evening">evning</span> or morning.
The light which we have <span class="varspell" title="gained">gain'd</span>, was <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> us, not to be ever staring
on, but by it to discover onward things more remote from our
knowledge. It is not the unfrocking of a Priest, the <span class="varspell" title="unmitering">unmitring</span> of a
Bishop, and the removing him from off the <span class="mi">Presbyterian</span> shoulders that
will make us a happy Nation, no, if other things as great in the
Church, and in the rule of life both <span class="varspell" title="economical">economicall</span> and <span class="varspell" title="political">politicall</span> be
not <span class="varspell" title="looked">lookt</span> into and <span class="varspell" title="reformed">reform'd</span>, we have <span class="varspell" title="looked">lookt</span> so long upon the blaze
that <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#zwingli" target="notes" name="zwingli"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Zwingli">Zuinglius</span></span></a> and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#calvin" target="notes" name="calvin"><span class="mi">Calvin</span></a> hath <span class="varspell" title="beaconed">beacon'd</span>
 up to us, that we are stark
blind. There be who perpetually complain of schisms and sects, and make 
it such a calamity that any man dissents from their maxims.
'Tis their own pride and ignorance which causes the disturbing, who
neither will hear with meeknes, nor can convince, yet all must be
<span class="varspell" title="suppressed">suppresst</span> which is not found in their <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#syntagma" target="notes" name="syntagma"><span class="mi">Syntagma</span></a>. They are the
troublers, they are the dividers of unity, who neglect and permit
not others to unite those <span class="varspell" title="dissevered">dissever'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="pieces">peeces</span> which are yet wanting to
the body of Truth. To be still searching what we know not, by what we
know, still closing up truth to truth as we find it (for all her
body is <span class="mi">homogeneal</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="proportional">proportionall</span>), this is the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#golden" target="notes" name="golden">golden rule</a> in
<span class="mi">Theology</span> as well as in <span class="varspell" title="Arithmetic">Arithmetick</span>, and makes up the best harmony in a
Church; not the <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span> and outward union of cold, and <span class="varspell" title="neutral">neutrall</span>, and
inwardly divided minds.

<p>
Lords and Commons of England, consider what Nation it is whereof
ye are, and whereof ye are the <span class="varspell" title="governors">governours</span>: a Nation not slow and
dull, but of a quick, ingenious, and piercing spirit, acute to
invent, <span class="varspell" title="subtle">suttle</span> and sinewy to <span class="varspell" title="discourse">discours</span>, not beneath the reach of any
point the highest that human capacity can soar to. Therefore the

<span class="mi">theologic</span> arts.  Yet that which is above all this, the <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> and the love of <span class="varspell" title="heaven">heav'n</span> we have great argument to think in a peculiar manner propitious and
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#propending" target="notes" name="propending">propending </a>towards us. Why else was this Nation <span class="varspell" title="chosen">chos'n</span> before any
other, that out of her as out of <span class="mi">Sion</span> should be <span class="varspell" title="proclaimed">proclam'd</span> and
sounded forth the first tidings and trumpet of Reformation to all
<span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Europe">Europ</span></span>. And had it not <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> the <span class="varspell" title="obstinate">obstinat</span> <span class="varspell" title="perverseness">perversenes</span> of our <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>
against the divine and admirable spirit of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#wyclif" target="notes" name="wyclif"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Wycliff">Wicklef</span></span></a>, to <span class="varspell" title="supress">suppresse</span> him
as a schismatic and <span class="mi">innovator</span>, perhaps neither the <span class="mi">Bohemian Husse</span> and
<span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jerome">Jerom</span></span>, no nor the name of <span class="mi">Luther</span>, or of <span class="mi">Calvin</span> had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> ever known: the glory of reforming all our <span class="varspell" title="neighbors">neighbours</span> had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="completely">compleatly</span> ours.
But now, as our <span class="varspell" title="obdurate">obdurat</span> Clergy have with violence <span class="varspell" title="demeaned">demean'd</span> the
matter, we are become hitherto the latest and backwardest <span class="varspell" title="Scholars">Schollers</span>, of
whom God <span class="varspell" title="offered">offer'd</span> to have made us the teachers. Now once again by all
concurrence of signs, and by the <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> instinct of holy and devout
men, as they daily and solemnly <span class="varspell" title="express">expresse</span> their thoughts, God is
decreeing to begin some new and great period in his Church, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> to
the reforming of Reformation it self: what does he then but reveal
Himself to his servants, and as his manner is, first to his
English-men; I say as his manner is, first to us, though we mark not
the method of his counsels, and are unworthy.  Behold now this vast City: a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#city" target="notes" name="city">City of refuge</a>, the mansion house of liberty, <span class="varspell" title="encompassed">encompast</span> and surrounded with his protection; the shop of
<span class="varspell" title="war">warre</span> hath not there more anvils and hammers waking, to fashion out
the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#plates" target="notes" name="plates">plates</a> and instruments of armed Justice in defence of
<span class="varspell" title="beleaguered">beleaguer'd</span> Truth, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> there be pens and heads there, sitting by
their studious lamps, musing, searching, revolving new notions and
<span class="varspell" title="ideas">idea's</span> wherewith to present, as with their homage and their fealty the
approaching Reformation: others as fast reading, trying all things,
assenting to the force of reason and convincement. What could a man
require more from a Nation so pliant and so prone to seek after
knowledge. What wants there to such a towardly and pregnant <span class="varspell" title="soil">soile</span>,
but wise and <span class="varspell" title="faithful">faithfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="laborers">labourers</span>, to make a knowing people, a Nation of
Prophets, of Sages, and of Worthies. We <span class="varspell" title="reckon">reck'n</span> more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> five months
yet to harvest; there need not be five weeks, had we but eyes to
lift up, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#fields" target="notes" name="fields">the fields are white already</a>.
  Where there is much desire to learn, there of necessity will be much 
arguing, much writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but
knowledge in the making. Under these fantastic terrors of sect and
schism, we wrong the earnest and zealous thirst after knowledge and
understanding which God hath <span class="varspell" title="stirred">stirr'd</span> up in this city. What some lament
of, we rather should <span class="varspell" title="rejoice">rejoyce</span> at, should rather praise this pious
<span class="varspell" title="forwardness">forwardnes</span> among men, to reassume the ill deputed care of their
Religion into their own hands again. A little generous prudence, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#for" target="notes" name="for">a
little forbearance of one another</a>, and <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> grain of charity might win
all these diligences to <span class="varspell" title="join">joyn</span>, and unite into one <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> and brotherly
search after Truth; could we but <span class="varspell" title="forgo">forgoe</span> this <span class="varspell" title="Prelatical">Prelaticall</span> tradition of
crowding free consciences and Christian liberties into canons and
precepts of men. I doubt not, if some great and worthy stranger should
come among us, wise to discern the <span class="varspell" title="mold">mould</span> and temper of a people, and
how to govern it, observing the high hopes and aims, the diligent
alacrity of our extended thoughts and reasonings in the pursuance of
truth and freedom, but that he would cry out as <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#pyrrhus" target="notes" name="pyrrhus"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Pyrrhus">Pirrhus</span></span></a> did,
admiring the Roman docility and courage, if such were my <span class="mi">Epirots</span>, I
would not despair the greatest design that could be attempted to make
a Church or Kingdom happy.  Yet these are the men <span class="varspell" title="cried">cry'd</span> out against for <span class="varspell" title="schismatics">schismaticks</span> and
sectaries; as if, while the Temple of the Lord was building, some
cutting, some squaring the marble, others hewing the cedars, there
should be a sort of <span class="varspell" title="irrational">irrationall</span> men who could not consider there must
be many schisms and many dissections made in the quarry and in the
timber, ere the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#irrat" target="notes" name="irrat">house of God</a> can be built. And when every stone is
laid artfully together, it cannot be united into a continuity, it
can but be contiguous in this world; neither can every <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of the
building be of one form; nay rather the perfection consists in this,
that out of many <span class="varspell" title="moderate">moderat</span> varieties and brotherly dissimilitudes that
are not vastly <span class="varspell" title="disproportional">disproportionall</span> arises the goodly and the <span class="varspell" title="graceful">gracefull</span>
symmetry that commends the whole pile and structure.  Let us therefore be more <span class="varspell" title="considerate">considerat</span> builders, more wise in
<span class="varspell" title="spititual">spirituall</span> architecture, when great reformation is expected. For now
the time seems come, wherein <span class="mi">Moses</span> the great Prophet may sit in <span class="varspell" title="heaven">heav'n</span>
<span class="varspell" title="rejoicing">rejoycing</span> to see that memorable and glorious wish of his <span class="varspell" title="fulfilled">fulfill'd</span>,
when not only our <span class="varspell" title="seventy">sev'nty</span> Elders, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#prophets" target="notes" name="prophets">but all the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> people are
become Prophets</a>. No marvell then though some men, and some good men too
perhaps, but young in <span class="varspell" title="goodness">goodnesse</span>, as <span class="mi">Joshua</span> then was, envy them. They
fret, and out of their own <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknes</span> are in agony, lest these divisions
and subdivisions will <span class="varspell" title="undo">undoe</span> us. The <span class="varspell" title="adversary">adversarie</span> again applauds, and waits
the hour, when they have <span class="varspell" title="branched">brancht</span> themselves out, saith he, small
<span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> into parties and partitions, then will be our time. Fool! he
sees not <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#root" target="notes" name="root">the firm root</a>, out of which we all grow, though into
branches: nor will be ware <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> he see our small divided <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#maniples" target="notes" name="maniples">maniples</a>
cutting through at every angle of his ill united and unweildy brigade.
And that we are to hope better of all these supposed sects and
schisms, and that we shall not need that solicitude honest perhaps
though over timorous of them that vex in this behalf, but shall
laugh in the end, at those malicious applauders of our differences, I
have these reasons to <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span> me.
</p>
<p>
First, when a City shall be as it were <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#block" target="notes" name="block"><span class="varspell" title="besieged">besieg'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="blocked">blockt</span> about</a>,
her navigable river infested, <span class="varspell" title="inroads">inrodes</span> and incursions round, defiance
and <span class="varspell" title="battle">battell</span> oft <span class="varspell" title="rumored">rumour'd</span> to be marching up <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> to her walls, and suburb
trenches, that then the people, or the greater part, more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> at
other times, wholly <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> up with the study of highest and most
important matters to be <span class="varspell" title="reformed">reform'd</span>, should be disputing, reasoning,
reading, inventing, discoursing, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> to a rarity, and admiration,
things not before <span class="varspell" title="discoursed">discourst</span> or <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> of, argues first a singular
good will, <span class="varspell" title="contentedness">contentednesse</span> and confidence in your prudent foresight, and
safe government, Lords and Commons; and from thence derives it self
to a gallant bravery and well grounded contempt of their enemies, as
if there were no small number of as great spirits among us, as his
was, who when Rome was nigh <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#han" target="notes" name="han"><span class="varspell" title="besieged">besieg'd</span> by <span class="mi">Hanibal</span></a>, being in the City, bought that <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of ground at no cheap rate, whereon <span class="mi">Hanibal</span> himself
<span class="varspell" title="encamped">encampt</span> his own regiment.  Next it is a lively and <span class="varspell" title="cheerful">cherfull</span> presage of our happy <span class="varspell" title="success">successe</span> and
victory. For as in a body, when the blood is fresh, the spirits pure
and vigorous, not only to vital, but to <span class="varspell" title="rational">rationall</span> faculties, and those
in the acutest, and the pertest operations of wit and <span class="varspell" title="subtlety">suttlety</span>, it
argues in what good plight and constitution the body is, so when the
<span class="varspell" title="cheerfulness">cherfulnesse</span> of the people is so sprightly up, as that it has not only
wherewith to guard well its own freedom and safety, but to spare,
and to bestow upon the solidest and sublimest points of <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span>,
and new invention, it <span class="varspell" title="betokens">betok'ns</span> us not degenerated, nor drooping to a
<span class="varspell" title="fatal">fatall</span> decay, but casting off the old and <span class="varspell" title="wrinkled">wrincl'd</span> skin of corruption
to outlive these pangs and wax young again, <span class="varspell" title="entering">entring</span> the glorious waies
of Truth and prosperous <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> <span class="varspell" title="destined">destin'd</span> to become great and
<span class="varspell" title="honorable">honourable</span> in these latter ages. Methinks I see in my mind a noble and
puissant Nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep, and
shaking her <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#nation" target="notes" name="nation">invincible locks</a>: Methinks I see her as an Eagle <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#mu" target="notes" name="mu">muing</a> her
mighty youth, and kindling her <span class="varspell" title="undazzled">undazl'd</span> eyes at the full midday beam;
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#purge" target="notes" name="purge">purging and unscaling her long abused sight</a> at the fountain it self
of <span class="varspell" title="heavenly">heav'nly</span> radiance; while the whole noise of timorous and flocking
birds, with those also that love the twilight, flutter about, <span class="varspell" title="amazed">amaz'd</span>
at what she means, and in their envious gabble would <span class="varspell" title="prognosticate">prognosticat</span> a
year of sects and schisms.
</p>

<p>
What would ye <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> then, should ye <span class="varspell" title="suppress">suppresse</span> all this <span class="varspell" title="flowery">flowry</span> crop of
knowledge and new light sprung up and yet springing daily in this
City, should ye set an <span class="mi">Oligarchy</span> of twenty <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ingross" target="notes" name="ingross"><span class="varspell" title="engrossers">ingrossers</span></a> over it, to
bring a <span class="varspell" title="famine">famin</span> upon our minds again, when we shall know nothing but
what is <span class="varspell" title="measured">measur'd</span> to us by their bushel? <span class="varspell" title="Believe">Beleeve</span> it, Lords and Commons,
they who <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span> ye to such a suppressing, <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> as good as bid ye
<span class="varspell" title="suppress">suppresse</span> your selves; and I will soon <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> how. If it be <span class="varspell" title="desired">desir'd</span> to
know the <span class="varspell" title="immediate">immediat</span> cause of all this free writing and free speaking,
there cannot be <span class="varspell" title="assigned">assign'd</span> a truer <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> your own mild, and free, and
human government; it is the liberty, Lords and Commons, which your
own valorous and happy counsels have <span class="varspell" title="purchased">purchast</span> us, liberty which is
the nurse of all great wits; this is that which hath <span class="varspell" title="rarified">rarify'd</span> and
<span class="varspell" title="enlightened">enlighten'd</span> our spirits like the influence of <span class="varspell" title="heaven">heav'n</span>; this is that
which hath <span class="varspell" title="enfranchised">enfranchis'd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="enlarged">enlarg'd</span> and lifted up our apprehensions
degrees above themselves.  Ye cannot make us now <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> capable, <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> knowing, <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> eagarly pursuing of the truth, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> ye first make your selves, that made us
so, <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> the lovers, <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> the founders of our true liberty. We can
grow ignorant again, brutish, <span class="varspell" title="formal">formall</span>, and slavish, as ye found us;
but you then must first become that which ye cannot be, oppressive,
arbitrary, and tyrannous, as they were from whom ye have <span class="varspell" title="freed">free'd us</span>. That
our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts more erected to the
search and expectation of greatest and exactest things, is the issue
of your <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertu</span> propagated in us; ye cannot <span class="varspell" title="suppress">suppresse</span> that <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span>
ye reinforce an <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#father" target="notes" name="father">abrogated and <span class="varspell" title="merciless">mercilesse</span> law</a>, that fathers may dispatch
at will their own children. And who shall then stick closest to ye,
and excite others? not he who takes up armes for <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#dane" target="notes" name="dane">cote and conduct</a>,
and his four nobles of Danegelt. Although I dispraise not the
defence of just immunities, yet love my peace better, if that were
all. Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely
according to conscience, above all liberties.
</p>

<p>
What would be best <span class="varspell" title="advised">advis'd</span> then, if it be found so hurtfull and so
<span class="varspell" title="unequal">unequall</span> to <span class="varspell" title="suppress">suppresse</span> opinions for the <span class="varspell" title="newness">newnes</span>, or the <span class="varspell" title="unsuitableness">unsutablenes</span>
to a customary acceptance, will not be my task to say; I only shall
repeat what I have <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnt</span> from one of your own <span class="varspell" title="honorable">honourable</span> number, a
right noble and pious Lord, who had he not <span class="varspell" title="sacrificed">sacrific'd</span> his life and
fortunes to the Church and Commonwealth, we had not now <span class="varspell" title="missed">mist</span> and
<span class="varspell" title="bewailed">bewayl'd</span> a worthy and undoubted patron of this argument. Ye know
him I am sure; yet I for <span class="varspell" title="honor's">honours</span> sake, and may it be <span class="varspell" title="eternal">eternall</span> to him,
shall name him, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#brook" target="notes" name="brook">the Lord <span class="mi">Brook</span></a>. He writing of Episcopacy, and by the
way treating of sects and schisms, left Ye his vote, or rather now the
last words of his dying charge, which I know will ever be of dear
and <span class="varspell" title="honored">honour'd</span> regard with Ye, so full of <span class="varspell" title="meekness">meeknes</span> and breathing
charity, that next to his last testament, who <span class="varspell" title="bequeathed">bequeath'd</span> love and
peace to his Disciples, I cannot call to mind where I have read or
heard words more mild and <span class="varspell" title="peaceful">peacefull</span>. He there exhorts us to hear with
patience and humility those, however they be <span class="varspell" title="miscalled">miscall'd</span>, that desire to
live purely, in such a use of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> Ordinances, as the best guidance
of their conscience gives them, and to tolerat them, though in some
disconformity to our selves. The book itself will tell us more at
large being <span class="varspell" title="published">publisht</span> to the world, and dedicated to the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>
by him who both for his life and for his death deserves, that what
advice he left be not laid by without <span class="varspell" title="perusal">perusall</span>.
</p>

<p>
And now the time in <span class="varspell" title="special">speciall</span> is, by <span class="varspell" title="privilege">priviledge</span> to write and speak what
may help to the <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span> discussing of matters in agitation. <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#janus" target="notes" name="janus">The temple
of <span class="mi">Janus</span></a> with his two <span class="mi">controversal</span> faces might now not
unsignificantly be set open. And though all the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#winds" target="notes" name="winds"><span class="varspell" title="winds">windes</span> of <span class="varspell" title="doctrine">doctrin</span></a> were
let loose to play upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do
injuriously, by licencing and prohibiting to misdoubt her strength.
Let her and <span class="varspell" title="Falsehood">Falshood</span> grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the <span class="varspell" title="worse">wors</span>,
in a free and open encounter. Her confuting is the best and surest
suppressing. He who hears what praying there is for light and
clearer knowledge to be sent down among us, would think of other
matters to be constituted beyond <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#dis" target="notes" name="dis">the discipline of <span class="mi">Geneva</span></a>, <span class="varspell" title="framed">fram'd</span>
and <span class="varspell" title="fabricked">fabric't</span> already to our hands. Yet when the new light which we beg
for shines in upon us, there be who envy, and oppose, if it come not
first in at their casements. What a collusion is this, whenas we are
exhorted by the wise man to use diligence, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#wisdom" target="notes" name="wisdom"><span class="mi">to seek for wisdom as for
<span class="varspell" title="hidden">hidd'n</span> treasures</span></a> early and late, that another order shall <span class="varspell" title="enjoin">enjoyn</span> us to
know nothing but by statute. When a man hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="laboring">labouring</span> the
hardest <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> in the deep mines of knowledge, hath <span class="varspell" title="furnished">furnisht</span> out
his findings in all their equipage, drawn forth his reasons as it were
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#battle" target="notes" name="battle">a <span class="varspell" title="battle">battell</span> <span class="varspell" title="ranged">raung'd</span></a>, <span class="varspell" title="scattered">scatter'd</span> and defeated all objections in his way,
calls out his adversary into the plain, offers him the advantage of
wind and sun, if he please; only that he may try the matter by dint of
argument, for his opponents then to <span class="varspell" title="skulk">sculk</span>, to lay ambushments, to keep
a narrow bridge of licencing where the challenger should <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span>,
though it be <span class="varspell" title="valor">valour</span> <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> in <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#souldiership" target="notes">souldiership</a>, is but <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknes</span>
 and
cowardice in the wars of Truth.  For who knows not that Truth is strong 
next to the Almighty; she needs no policies, nor stratagems, nor 
licencings to make her
victorious, those are the shifts and the defences that error uses
against her power: give her but room, <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> do not bind her when she
sleeps, for then she speaks not true, as the old <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#proteus" target="notes" name="proteus"><span class="mi">Proteus</span></a> did, who
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#caught" target="notes" name="caught">spake oracles</a> only when he was caught <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> bound, but then rather she
turns herself into all shapes, except her own, and perhaps tunes her
voice according to the time, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ahab" target="notes" name="ahab">as <span class="mi">Micaiah</span> did before <span class="mi">Ahab</span></a>, <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> she
be <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ad" target="notes" name="ad"><span class="varspell" title="adjured">adjur'd</span> into her own <span class="varspell" title="likeness">likenes</span></a>. Yet is it not impossible that she
may have more shapes <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> one.  What else is all that rank of things
indifferent, wherein Truth may be on this side, or on the other,
without being unlike her self. What but a vain shadow else is the
abolition of <span class="mi"><a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#frank" target="notes" name="frank">those ordinances</a>, that hand writing <span class="varspell" title="nailed">nayl'd</span> to the
<span class="varspell" title="cross">crosse</span></span>, what great purchase is <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#paul" target="notes" name="paul">this Christian liberty</a> which <span class="mi">Paul</span> so
often boasts of. His doctrine is, that he who eats or eats not,
regards a day, or regards it not, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#bob" target="notes" name="bob">may <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> either</a> to the Lord. How many
other things might be tolerated in peace, and left to conscience,
had we but charity, and were it not the chief strong hold of our
<span class="varspell" title="hypocrisy">hypocrisie</span> to be ever 
judging one another.  I fear yet this iron yoke of outward conformity 
hath left a slavish print upon our necks; the ghost of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ghost" target="notes" name="ghost">a <span class="varspell" title="linen">linnen</span> decency</a> yet haunts us. We stumble and are impatient at the least dividing of one
visible congregation from another, though it be not in <span class="varspell" title="fundamentals">fundamentalls</span>;
and through our <span class="varspell" title="forwardness">forwardnes</span> to <span class="varspell" title="suppress">suppresse</span>, and our <span class="varspell" title="backwardness">backwardnes</span> to
recover any <span class="varspell" title="enthralled">enthrall'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of truth out of the <span class="varspell" title="grip">gripe</span> of <a name="custom">custom</a>, we
care not to keep truth separated from truth, which is the fiercest
rent and disunion of all. We <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not see that while we still affect by
all means a rigid <span class="varspell" title="external">externall</span> formality, we may as soon fall again into a
<span class="varspell" title="gross">grosse</span> conforming stupidity, a stark and dead congealment of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#wood" target="notes" name="wood"><span class="mi">wood and
hay and stubble</span></a> <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span> and frozen together, which is more to the
sudden degenerating of a Church <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> many <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#sub" target="notes" name="sub"><span class="mi">subdichotomies</span></a> of petty
schisms.  Not that I can think well of every light separation, or that all
in a Church is to be expected <span class="mi">gold and silver and <span class="varspell" title="precious">pretious</span> stones:</span>
it is not possible for man to <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#tares" target="notes" name="tares">sever the wheat from the tares</a>, the
good fish from the other <span class="varspell" title="fry">frie</span>; that must be the <span class="varspell" title="Angels'">Angels</span> <span class="varspell" title="Ministry">Ministery</span> at the
end of <span class="varspell" title="moratl">mortall</span> things. Yet if all cannot be of one mind, as who looks
they should be? this <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtles</span> is more <span class="varspell" title="wholesome">wholsome</span>, more prudent, and
more Christian that many be tolerated, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> all <span class="varspell" title="compelled">compell'd</span>. I
mean not tolerated Popery, and open superstition, which as it
<span class="varspell" title="extirpates">extirpats</span> all religions and <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> supremacies, so it self should be
<span class="varspell" title="extirpate">extirpat</span>, provided first that all charitable and <span class="varspell" title="compassionate">compassionat</span>
means be <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> to win and regain the weak and the misled: that also
which is impious or evil absolutely either against faith or <span class="varspell" title="manners">maners</span> no
law can possibly permit, that intends not to unlaw it self: but those
neighboring differences, or rather indifferences, are what I speak
of, whether in some point of doctrine or of discipline, which though they may be many, yet need not interrupt <span class="mi">the unity of Spirit</span>, if we could but find among us <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#bond" target="notes" name="bond"><span class="mi">the bond of peace</span>. </a> In the mean while if any one would write, and bring his <span class="varspell" title="helpful">helpfull</span> hand to the slow-moving Reformation which we <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> under, if Truth have
<span class="varspell" title="spoken">spok'n</span> to him before others, or but <span class="varspell" title="seemed">seem'd</span> at least to speak, who hath
so bejesuited us that we should trouble that man with asking licence
to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> so worthy a deed? and not consider this, that if it come to
prohibiting, there is not ought more likely to be prohibited <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>
truth it self; whose first appearance to our eyes <span class="varspell" title="bleared">blear'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="dimmed">dimm'd</span>
with prejudice and <a name="custom2">custom</a>, is more unsightly and unplausible <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> many
errors, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> as the person is of many a great man slight and
contemptible to see to. And what <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> they tell us vainly of new
opinions, when this very opinion of theirs, that none must be heard,
but whom they like, is the worst and newest opinion of all others; and
is the chief cause why sects and schisms <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> so much abound, and true
knowledge is kept at distance from us; besides yet a greater danger
which is in it.  For when God <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#shake" target="notes" name="shake">shakes a <span class="varspell" title="Kingdom">Kingdome</span></a> with strong and <span class="varspell" title="healthful">healthfull</span> commotions
to a <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> reforming, 'tis not untrue that many sectaries and false
teachers are then busiest in seducing; but yet more true it is, that
God then raises to his own work men of rare abilities, and more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>
common industry not only to look back and revise what hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span>
taught heretofore, but to gain <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span> and <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> on, some new
<span class="varspell" title="enlightened">enlighten'd</span> steps in the discovery of truth. For such is the order
of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> <span class="varspell" title="enlightening">enlightning</span> his Church, to dispense and deal out by
degrees his beam, so as our earthly eyes may best sustain it.  Neither is God appointed and <span class="varspell" title="confined">confin'd</span>, where and out of what place these his chosen shall be first heard to speak; for he sees not as man sees, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#choose" target="notes" name="choose">chooses not as man chooses</a>,
 lest we should devote our selves again to set places, and assemblies, 
and outward callings of men; planting our faith one while in the old 
Convocation house, and another
while in the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#chapel" target="notes" name="chapel"><span class="varspell" title="Chapel">Chapell</span> at Westminster</a>; when all the faith and religion
that shall be there <span class="varspell" title="canonized">canoniz'd</span>, is not sufficient without plain
convincement, and the charity of patient instruction to supple the
least bruise of conscience, to <span class="varspell" title="edify">edifie</span> the meanest Christian, who
desires to walk in the Spirit, and not in the letter of human trust,
for all the number of voices that can be there made; no though
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#harry" target="notes" name="harry"><span class="mi">Harry</span> the 7</a>. himself there, with all his leige tombs about him, should
lend them voices from the dead, to swell their number.  And if the men be erroneous who appear to be the leading <span class="varspell" title="schismatics">schismaticks</span>, what witholds us but our sloth, our self-will, and distrust in the right cause, that we <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not give them gentle meeting
and gentle dismissions, that we debate not and <span class="varspell" title="examine">examin</span> the matter
<span class="varspell" title="thoroughly">throughly</span> with <span class="varspell" title="liberal">liberall</span> and frequent audience; if not for their sakes,
yet for our own? seeing no man who hath tasted learning, but will
<span class="varspell" title="confess">confesse</span> the many <span class="varspell" title="ways">waies</span> of profiting by those who not contented with
stale <span class="varspell" title="receipts">receits</span> are able to manage, and set forth new positions to
the world. And were they but as the dust and cinders of our feet, so
long as in that notion they may yet serve to polish and brighten the
<span class="varspell" title="armory">armoury</span> of Truth, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> for that respect they were not utterly to be
cast away. But if they be of those whom God hath fitted for the
<span class="varspell" title="special">speciall</span> use of these times with eminent and ample gifts, and those
perhaps neither among the Priests, nor among the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#perhaps" target="notes" name="perhaps">Pharisees</a>, and we in
the hast of a precipitant zeal shall make no distinction, but resolve
to stop their mouths, because we fear they come with new and dangerous
opinions, as we commonly forejudge them ere we understand them, no
<span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> woe to us, while thinking thus to defend the Gospel, we are
found the persecutors.

<p>
There have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> not a few since the beginning of this <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>,
both of the Presbytery and others who by their <span class="varspell" title="unlicensed">unlicen't</span> books to
the contempt of an <span class="mi">Imprimatur</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#ice" target="notes" name="ice">first broke that triple ice</a> clung about
our hearts, and taught the people to see day: I hope that none of
those were the <span class="varspell" title="persuaders">perswaders</span> to renew upon us this bondage which they
themselves have wrought so much good by contemning. But if neither the
check that <span class="mi">Moses</span> gave to young <span class="mi">Joshua</span>, nor the countermand which <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#counter" target="notes" name="counter">our
<span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> gave to young <span class="mi">John</span></a>, who was so ready to prohibit those whom he
thought <span class="varspell" title="unlicensed">unlicenc't</span>, be not <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> to admonish our <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#elders" target="notes" name="elders">Elders </a>how
unacceptable to God their testy mood of prohibiting is, if neither
their own remembrance what <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> hath abounded in the Church by this
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#lett" target="notes" name="lett"><span class="varspell" title="let">lett</span></a> of licencing, and what good they themselves have begun by
transgressing it, be not <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, but that they will <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span>, and
execute the most <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#dom" target="notes" name="dom"><span class="mi">Dominican</span></a> part of the Inquisition over us, and are
already with one foot in the stirrup so active at suppressing, it
would be no <span class="varspell" title="unequal">unequall</span> distribution in the first place to <span class="varspell" title="suppress">suppresse</span> the
suppressors themselves; whom the change of their condition hath puft
up, more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> their late experience of harder times hath made wise.

<p>
And as for regulating the <span class="varspell" title="Press">Presse</span>, let no man think to have the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span>
of advising ye better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> your selves have done in that Order
<span class="varspell" title="published">publisht</span> next before this, that no book be Printed, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> the
<span class="varspell" title="Printer's">Printers</span> and the <span class="varspell" title="Author's">Authors</span> name, or at least the <span class="varspell" title="Printer's">Printers</span> be
<span class="varspell" title="registered">register'd</span>. Those which otherwise come forth, if they be found
mischievous and libellous, the fire and the executioner will be the
timeliest and the most <span class="varspell" title="effectual">effectuall</span> remedy, that <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> prevention can use.
For this <span class="mi">authentic</span> Spanish policy of licencing books, if I have said
aught, will prove the most <span class="varspell" title="unlicensed">unlicenc't</span> book it self within a short
while; and was the <span class="varspell" title="immediate">immediat</span> image of a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#star" target="notes" name="star">Star-chamber decree</a> to that
purpose made in those very times when that Court did the rest of those
her pious works, for which she is now <span class="varspell" title="fallen">fall'n</span> from the <span class="varspell" title="Stars">Starres</span> with
<span class="mi">Lucifer</span>. Whereby ye may <span class="varspell" title="guess">guesse</span> what <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of State prudence, what love
of the people, what care of Religion, or good manners there was at
the contriving, although with singular <span class="varspell" title="hypocrisy">hypocrisie</span> it pretended to
bind books to their good <span class="varspell" title="behavior">behaviour</span>. And how it got the upper hand of
your precedent Order so well constituted before, if we may <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span>
those men whose profession gives them cause to <span class="varspell" title="inquire">enquire</span> most, it may be
doubted there was in it the fraud of some old <span class="mi">patentees</span> and
<span class="mi">monopolizers</span> in the trade of book-selling; who under pretence of the
poor in their Company not to be defrauded, and the just retaining of
each man his <span class="varspell" title="several">severall</span> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Emilton/reading_room/areopagitica/notes.shtml#copy2" target="notes" name="copy">copy</a>, which God forbid should be gainsaid,

<span class="varspell" title="colors">colours</span>, and serving to no end except it be to exercise a

in an honest profession to which learning is <span class="varspell" title="indebted">indetted</span>, that they
should be made other mens <span class="varspell" title="vassals">vassalls</span>. Another end is thought was <span class="varspell" title="aimed">aym'd</span>

power in their hands, malignant books might the easier scape abroad,

 I skill not: This I know, that errors in a good government and in a bad
