The advent of writing greatly
improved the tracking of property rights, and indeed gave
rise to our modern systems of property rights and law.  However,
written records have proven to be quite vulnerable to
abuse.  A common pattern during eras of 
<a href="http://chronicle.com/free/99/06/99061701t.htm">
political instability or oppression 
</a> 
has been the
confiscation of land
via the forgery or destruction of public
records.   Reconstruction from informal records,
such as residency recorded in phone books, even when possible
is costly
and fraught with error
and potential for fraud [6].  Large amounts of, in some areas most, property
in developing countries is not formally titled [5].
Even during eras of political stability in developed countries,
there occur many expensive problems with 
<a href="http://hobbyfarm.com/buysell11.html">
titles.</a>   Straightforward transcription of written records 
into a centralized online repository would make many of
these problems even worse -- electronic records can be highly 
vulnerable to loss and forgery, and insiders are the most
common source of such attacks.  This paper proposes a secure, distributed
title database to prevent such attacks against property rights in the future.
</p><p>
Many kinds of Internet resources have a basic characteristic:
users must agree on their control across trust boundaries.  A big example is names.  The article
<a href="http://zooko.com/distnames.html">Names: Decentralized, Secure, Human-Meaningful: Choose Two</a> dismisses not only the ubiquity and importance of this problem, but also the possibility of solution.  Instead <a href="http://www.erights.org/elib/capability/pnml.html">petnames</a> are proposed.  These are at best mere mnemonics to translate human-readable into cryptographic names; petnames don't do anything to secure naming across trust boundaries.  All three attributes -- decentralized, secure, and human-meaningful --  must be provided if people are to communicate and be communicated about securely over the Internet, and this paper along with the article <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/distributed.html">Advances in Distributed Security</a> shows how to provide all three.   
</p><p> More generally, we show how to implement transferable global rights,
enforced entirely by protocol, to names, attributions, <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BitGold">bit gold</a>, and similar purely 
informatic property owned by a particular entity but possessed and
relied upon by the public, and how to implement a secure title database 
for other kinds of property.  For a particular example of
cross-trust-boundary rights enforced entirely by protocol, see my 
proposal for <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/nameintegrity.html">name integrity in cross-trust-boundary file systems</a>.
</p><p>
In all cases of property rights there is a defined space, whether a namespace
or physical space, and the task is to agree on simple attributes
of or rights to control subdivisions of that space.  
In some cases a name or other symbol corresponds to a person
or object 
owned or controlled by that person. For
example, Internet users must agree on which domain name corresponds 
to which web site operator. 
In other cases we are simply concerned with control over
a subdivision of the space. With real estate we must agree on who owns
various rights (to occupy the surface, to mine the minerals under, etc.)
to a piece of land.  With radio spectrum we must agree on who owns
what range of frequencies and in what physical space (or transmitting 
power as an easily observed approximation of physical space used).
</p><p>
It is the author's hypothesis that all such 
agreements of control, including control over the semantics of symbols,
to be made and respected across trust boundaries 
are problems of agreeing on and maintaining property rights.  Thus the 
results of this 
paper are far more general than they might
first appear -- I believe this paper provides a solution to secure
namespaces and similar problems as well
as the problem of securely recording agreements on traditional property 
rights.   Highlighting the property rights nature of public directories
also highlights the limitations of these mappings -- for example that 
names, addresses, and other symbols whose semantics
are controlled by a person can often be delegated, 
just as property can be given or rented. 
</p><p>
New advances in replicated database technology will give us
the ability to securely maintain and
transfer ownership for a wide variety of kinds of property,
including not only land but chattels, securities, names, and
addresses. This
technology will give us public records which can "survive a nuclear
war", along the lines of the original design goal of the Internet.
 While thugs can 
still take physical property by force, the continued existence of 
correct ownership records will remain a thorn in the side of usurping 
claimants.  
</p><p>
I use political words in 
this essay as metaphors to describe how our hypothetical
property title software, and especially its protocol for distributing 
the title database across a public network, could work.  
  A group, called a property club, 
gets together on the Internet [2] and decides to  keep track of the
ownership of some kind of property.   
The property is represented by titles: names referring to the property, 
and the public key
corresponding to a private key held by its current owner, signed by the
previous owner, along with a chain of previous such titles. Title names may
"completely" describe the property, for example allocations in a namspace.
(Of course, names always refer to something, the semantics, so such
a description is not really complete).  Or the title names might simply 
be labels referring to the property.  Various descriptions and
rules -- maps, deeds, and so on -- may be included. 
</p><p>
The  property club can be thought of as a "microgovernment", an
entity that performs globally and independently one narrow function
normally associated with government.  In particular it is a "constitutional 
microdemocracy" with low entry and exit costs.  
After the rules of
property transfer have been decided, each vote should stay within this
constitution -- so that normally the vote will simply implement a
distributed operation according to the property rules.  The voting
is necessary not due to a democratic political ideology but 
because it is the optimal result in analysis of distributed databases
with malicious attackers.[1]  If the rules
are violated by the winning voters, the correct losers can exit the group
and reform  a new group, inheriting the old titles.   Users of the titles
(relying parties) who wish to maintain correct titles can securely verify 
for themselves which splinter group has correctly followed the rules and 
switch to the correct group.   If the rules are violated by losing voters,
they can be excluded from further participation both by correct winners 
and rule-following relying parties.

</p><p>   This voting-or-reformation method works well where exit costs are low.
Thus in practice users should not 
"put all their eggs in one basket", but different 
title clubs should be used for different
kinds of property.  Note that the key security feature of the club
is not the voting, but a set of objective, often automated, rules and
an unforgeable audit trail that allows both club members and relying
parties to check whether each vote followed the rules.  
So, to
go further with the political metaphor,
a property club is a "constitutional microdemocracy" with most of
the emphasis on the "constitutional".   The voting is necessary,
but is quite regulated.
</p><p>

To implement a property club, we set up a replicated database so that the
club members, hereafter "servers", can securely maintain titles  of
ownership, and securely transfer them upon the request of current owners.
Actually getting end users to respect the property rights agreed upon by
this system will be dependent on the specific nature of the property, and
is beyond the scope of the current inquiry. The purpose of the replicated 
database is simply to securely agree on who owns what.   The entire
database is public.  
<!-- Confidentiality will be addressed below. -->
</p><p>

The ideal title database would have the following  properties:
</p><p>

(1) Current owner Alice should be able transfer her title to only a single
relying counterparty (similar to the "double spending" problem in digital
cash)
</p><p>

(2) Servers should not be able to forge transfers
</p><p>

(3) Servers should not be able to block transfers to or from
politically incorrect parties.
</p><p>
We cannot achieve ideals (1) and (3), so we introduce "voting" as follows.
A good model of secure replicated databases is the "Byzantine
Quorum System" of
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~dalia/">Malkhi &amp; Reiter</a>[1].   
In contrast to most recent work in peer-to-peer software, our
design is based on mathematical proofs of security rather than hand-waving.
For a short discussion of such threshold-of-servers approaches,
see my essay 
<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/coalition.html">"Coalition Design for Secure Protocols"</a>.
The database is replicated 
across a universe of servers U, |U|=n.   The "quorum system" is a
collection of  subsets (quora) of these servers, each pair of which
intersect.  Each quorum can operate on behalf of the system;
intersection guarantees that operations done on distinct quora preserve
consistency.   A quorum system tolerant of Byzantine (unconditionally
malicious) server failures is a collection of subsets of servers, each pair
of which intersect in a set containing sufficiently many correct servers to
guarantee the consistency of the replicated data.   The authors construct a
protocol such that any intersection contains at least  2f+1 servers, thus
providing resilience against up to f malicious servers, n &gt; 4f.
</p><p>

Using these results it looks like we can approach our ideal title database
as follows:
</p><p>

(1)  Alice signs the title and Bob's public key, and sends this message
to 2f+1 servers, committing her to transfer title to Bob.  Bob checks at
least 2f+1 servers before relying on Alice's transfer.  
</p><p>

(2) No collusion of servers can forge Alice's signature (we achieve at
least this property ideally!)
</p><p>

(3) A conspiracy of  &gt;=(1/4)n servers can block a transfer.   Alice's only
recourse is to use some other channels to broadcast her intention,
demonstrating that the registry did not follow her wishes, and hoping the
alternative channels are more reliable.  Bob only has similar recourse if
he signed a document with Alice demonstrating their intentions to transfer
title from Alice to Bob.  The most basic recourse is a correct
subset of servers which exits the property club and establishes a new one, then
advertises its correctness (and proves the incorrectness of its
rival group) as described above.
</p><p>

Sharing control over property, for example as security for a loan, 
could be accomplished by sharing the private key corresponding to the 
current owner's public key.  Possession of this private key is 
required to sign over title; multiparty threshold signatures could 
also be handled.  So it may be a good idea to use one keypair for each 
combination of title and current owner, rather than keypairs 
representing the identities of owners.  When certain contractual 
conditions are met, such as the last payment on a loan,
this could trigger the generation of a new keypair held solely by the
owner, and transfer of title from the shared keypair to the new keypair.
</p><p>


</p><h3>Divisibility and Homesteading</h3>
<p>
The initial allocations might occur by mapping existing property
rights from their current institutional incarnation, or by using
traditional methods of staking and negotiating mutual recognition
of claims.  Some methods less dependent on an existing legal regime
for the rights will be discussed in this section.
</p><p>

For some kinds of allocation, such as spatial regions or a hierarchical
namespace, we wish to be able to subdivided and re-merge properties.
Current owner Alice should be able to transfer various fractional
portions of her title to multiple single relying counterparties.
One possibility is to have "divide" or "merge" messages
whereby the current owner of a property can retire  the old 
property specifications(s) and link them to new property spec(s), 
the whole message being signed by the owner.   Then the
new property spec(s) are introduced and considered active,
and the old ones considered deactivated.  It would be the 
responsibility subsequent transferees to ensure that the
new specifications do not intersect, and are otherwise in good 
order.

</p><p>
One way to approach the homesteading, or initial allocation,
problem, I call the "emergent respect" style: Alice claims the entire 
unallocated universe.  Bob also claims it, the same property spec under 
a different digital signature.  They then may choose to subdivide, 
sell, give away, etc. property. Each conflicting root grows like a 
tree into an allocation of all property.
</p><p>

How to resolve trees with conflicting roots?   Eventually,
the thugs, mechanisms, or informal agreements which enforce property 
rights converge on a particular tree as the standard, proper allocation.  
Roots who give away more property to more people, or who actually deploy
mechanisms to protect their property, will gain more respect
for the tree they started.
</p><p>

In a namespace, conflicts may be resolved by giving names to 
the conflicting roots, and keeping track of those name-subtree 
mappings as property.
</p><p>

Usurpers may be able to steal property by setting up their own root and
enforcing it, but they can't delete the alternative allocations.
The history is always there as evidence for claims.
</p><p>
Those with no firsthand knowledge of conflicting claims may resolve
them by consulting authorities, and weighing the opinions of these 
authorities according to trust metrics, similar to trust metrics 
sometimes used for public key certificates.
</p><p>
With secure timestamps, homesteading could be done on a 
first-come rather than emergent respect basis.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Adverse Possession</h3>
For some kinds of property we might want to add the right of
adverse possession, or formalized squatting.  Here's one
general way to implement a kind of adverse possession: 
<pre>(1) Transfers must be securely timestamped.
(2) Transfers expire.  To maintain ownership, the
owner must issue a new transfer to self before 
expiration.
(3) Upon expiration, the property may be homestead
on a first-come or emergent respect basis.
</pre>
<p> This method doesn't attempt to define or utilize a state of "disuse".  
Instead it equates activity of the property with the ongoing active online 
presence of an owner who knows about the title and wishes to continue 
ownership.  Cost of maintaining the title might be made high by requiring
a periodic registry fee from owners.  However, this
introduces the problem of who obtains the benefit, by property club
rules, of the profits from this fee, and the problem of that
the fee lowers the profit of owning the property, even perhaps
making it negative.   One possibility, where costs of protecting
the property are high, is to charge a "Georgian tax" based on
some imprecise but objective estimate of the value potential of the 
property, and allocate the fees to the task of securing the property.  
To come up with this estimate, or to account for usage of the property 
itself, would involve mechanisms or observation of characteristics 
specific to the kind of property, to which subject we now turn.

</p><h3>Correspondence to Ground</h3>
Largely unaddressed above is the problem of divergence between actual
conditions and directory rights.  For example, squatters might
legitimately, in the eyes of most property rights enforcers,
occupy and improve unused land which a title registry indicates is owned by
others.   De Soto[5] describes squatters and
emergent property rights on the American frontier and today's
developing world.   When names are property, a name may violate a 
pre-existing trademark, causing the confusion that both the new
namespace and the old trademark namespace were designed to solve.
<p>
When divergence becomes too great, a solution to address the unreality 
of the title registry is needed.   One such solution is for the 
squatters to set up their own rival registry, and then prove the superior 
correspondence of their registry to actual reality over control and use 
of the resources.  Another solution for squatters is to use the adverse 
possession mechanism described above -- but this works only if the 
cost of maintaining the title is sufficiently high.
</p><p>
Another solution is to examine the incentives of the titled owner, to see
if they correspond to truthfully claiming control over a resource.  In
most cases there may be incentive to lie, and we can't use this method.
In some cases there is incentive to tell the truth and we can, with
caveats, rely on it.  Any such incentive assumption in the property
rules should be explicated, so that relying parties can examine whether
the conditions creating the incentive still hold.
</p><p>
Another solution is for property club rules and the registry to
originally incorporate rich information about the actual state of
property, and modify the actual ownership and transfer on this
property based on that state, in a way that leaves few ambiguities
so it can be fully audited by club members and third parties.
It is most advantageous when this auditing can remain automated, as
envisioned above.   However the introduction as rule criteria
of unrecorded (or unsecurely recorded) transient states common in
physical property causes auditing, and thus the titles, to become 
both less secure and more expensive.


<!-- h3>Confidential Ownership</h3>
<p>

Using a new key pair for each transfer, besides facilitating
shared control over property, can also help solve the 
confidentiality problem, and make it so that servers
cannot discriminate against politically incorrect parties.
This takes advantage of the "blindfolded justice" effect
provided by anonymity.  The holder of the unique key
can remain anonymous (to some extent, see caveats below)
and still transfer the title to others.
One could contact the owners if they incorporate remailer-return envelopes 
with the title.
<p>
Anonymous property titles would have some other interesting consequences.
Let's say there's a public good which nobody has incentive to fund unless 
they own most of a certain kind of property.  (For example, the classic
stock market takeover, where only holders of large voting blocks will put in
the oversight needed to straighten out management).  They could purchase 
property under different keys without raising suspicion that a takeover
is underway.  Of course, the same strategy could be used to
create monopolies for less useful purposes.
<p>
If potential users of a property don't know who the owner of the property 
is, that might make practical enforcement of some kinds of property rights 
difficult.  To enforce Alice's rights, she may have to prove to a jurisdiction
that she owns the property.  She can prove that the titled owner claims
that she owns (not the same thing as proving that she owns, but perhaps
good enough for enforcement purposes) by signing her jurisdictional 
name with the current owner's key.  To completely prove that
she owns, she would have to transfer the title to her jurisdictional name.
(The jurisdiction being the entity that actually physically
enforces the property rights, where this is necessary).
In either case, it seems she has to reveal her jurisdictional identity
in order to enforce her rights.

<p>

Self-enforcing property protection protocols might allow more
anonymity, where these are feasible.
<p>

Some kinds of property would naturally be associated 
with some physical location, and thereby not be very anonymous.
Furthermore, a mass of transaction detail can accumulate in the
public database, revealing unique patterns of behavior.  So
overall the anonymity is pretty weak even with use-once keys,
and may raise problems with hidden monopolies and enforcement.
<p>

So it would be nice if the servers could be trusted not to block
trades even when they know the identities of the owners.  In
the design I suggested a conspiracy of >=1/4 of the servers can so
block.  It might also be nice if some sort of blinding/mixing mechanism
(a la digital cash) could be introduced to unlink trades between these 
identities while maintaining the integrity of ownership transfer,
so that the public database doesn't reveal so much traffic information.
<p>

<!-- h3>Keeping Servers Honest</h3>
<p>
The two theoretical areas dealing with this are Byzantine agreement
(used here) and multiparty secure computation.  Some recent work
in these areas has been done by:
<pre>
<a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~canetti/">Ran Canetti</a>
<a href="http://www.toc.lcs.mit.edu/~oded/">Oded Goldreich</a>
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~dalia/">Dahlia Maklhi</a>
</pre>
The Byzantine agreement and related results typically require n>3f.
(n is the number of servers and f is the number of maliciously
faulty, or "Byzantine", servers that can be tolerated).
Multiparty secure comptutions achieve n>2f but assume Byzantine 
agreement for synchronization, so they have in theory
a 3f "security hole".
<p>

Variations don't always achieve such numbers.  The Malkhi/Meiter
replicated database achieved only n>4f.  (They do have a newer
paper I haven't read which may improve upon this by going
to "highly probable" security).
<p>

Under the assumption of digital signatures, agreement can be reached
in n > f. This gives the same abstract trust model as the untraceability
of anonymous remailers.  (Of course, actually getting the message 
through requires all n remailers to work properly, so in that sense 
even cf reliability is better than remailers).  It would be neat if 
one could do a replicated database with such a high trust
threshold, but I haven't seen anything like that in the literature
and there may be good reasons why we can't.
<p>

Economic security models would be desirable here, but are not
ready for prime time.  Deciding what the preferences and resources of the 
attacker should be
is tough.  Economists assume some typical probability
distribution of preferences, and some constant amount of wealth.
Cryptographers, and even some people studying fault tolerance,
assume a much more powerful and malicious adversary: with polynomial 
computational resources, and preferring to do the most damage 
possible to the user.   The Byzantine attacker's utility is 
precisely the negative utility of the user!
<p>

Economic models tend to look at linear or constant differences (Mallet can't
make more money than it costs him to crack the security, so Mallet
won't try to crack it) whereas cryptographers prefer super-polynomial
differences (the cost to Mallet is super-polynomial in a security
parameter controlled by the defender).  Economic models bear
some similiarity to the "benign" models of statistically
distributed error in fault tolerance (as opposed to the "Byzantine" 
models of maximally malicious faults).  However, once security
models bubble up to the level of trading off f vs. 2f vs. 3f
security, we have the same linear structure as an economic
model.  So it would make sense to introduce economics at
that level of analysis.
<p>

Economic security ideas like "exposure" make a lot of sense, 
especially for financial security.   An example is the the ATM limit of
$300/day: this is the user's "exposure", the most she can lose, to a 
crack of the ATM system.  This is a "knob" which can be adjusted
to reflect the current costs of cracking the security.  
<p>

So it would be nice to come up with good theories along these lines at 
some point.  Another nice thing might be a theoretical regime
"in between" economics and cryptography, dealing with 
resource and preference differences within the polynomial
range (e.g., O(n<sup>4</sup>) vs. O(n)).
