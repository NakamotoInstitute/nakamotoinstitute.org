</p><h4>	Bearer Certificates</h4>

<p>
"Digital bearer certificate" is a broad term developed by this
author[1] incorporating at least two emerging technologies: digital 
cash and distributed capabilities (secure distributed object 
references).   I will first describe the Chaumian protocol and 
its innovative privacy feature.  I will then discuss how these 
ideas map to the world of capabilities in the section on 
generic vs. specific rights.  I have altered digital cash 
terminology from digital cash to bearer certificate 
or token, from mint to issuer or transfer agent, and so on to 
reflect the ability of Chaum's protocols to generalize.
Chaumian bearer certificates implement standardized rights
transferable regardless of the identity of the holder.  Each 
kind of contract (for example, each denomination of "coin" in digital 
cash) corresponds to a digital signature, just as each issue of Federal 
Reserve Notes or stock certificates corresponds to a particular plate. 
</p><p>
In the most straightforward Chaumian protocol, the issuer 
and transfer agent (the same entity, for our purposes, though they 
can easily be unbundled) create a serial number (really a large
unguessable random number, rather than a sequence), and append it to a 
list of issued certificates. The transfer agent clears a transfer 
(i.e,. redeems the certificate) by
checking the signature to identify the class of bearer contract
and verify that it was made, then looking on that contract's issued 
list to make sure the serial number is there, then removing the 
serial number. Alternatively, the issuer can let the issuee make up the
serial number, then, when cleared, check the signature and put the 
number on the list of cleared certificates. The signature provides 
the assurance that the certificate is indeed the the particular kind
of contract with bearer, while the serial number assures that the 
same instance of that contract is not cleared or redeemed more than 
once. In these simple versions, the transfer agent can link the
transferee to the transferor for all transfers. To implement the 
privacy characteristics of coins and physical bearer certificates, 
we need to add unlinkability features. 

</p><h4>		Blind Signatures </h4>
Meet the greatest simple equation since e=mc<sup>2</sup>:
<pre>gSf(m) = S(m)
</pre>
S is a digital signature.  f  is the blinding function, and g an 
unblinding function.  The blinding functions are usually based on a 
secret random number called the "blinding factor".   m is
another random number, a unique identifier which can, for example,
refer to an instance of some object.
<p>

The idea is very clever but very simple.  It may be counterintuitive 
because the simplest physical world metaphor of this highly useful 
e-commerce primitive sounds worse than useless:  Alice can get Carol 
to sign a blank check!  Here's how:
</p><p>

(1) Alice generates m and blinds it.  "Blinding" is just a one-time-pad 
encryption to oneself,  f(m).   She sends this to Carol.   This is like 
taking a piece of paper and sealing it inside an envelope which Carol 
can't open or see through.
</p><p>

(2) Carol signs it: Sf(m), and sends this back to Alice.   This
is like Carol signing the outside of the envelope.
</p><p>

(3) Alice unblinds it: gSf(m) = S(m).   Carol has also
signed the paper Alice put inside the envelope!
</p><p>

The genius behind this discovery: cryptography  guru David 
Chaum.  The brilliance lies in step 3: Chaum discovered that
some signatures have the property of being "commutative"
with the blinding functions: Alice can strip off the blinding
in the reverse order which the blinding and signature
were applied, leaving just Alice's signature of n.  It is as if
Alice put a piece of  carbon paper inside the envelope!  
</p><p>

In particular for RSA signatures, with public key (pq, e)
and private key d, the blind signature functions are the following
modulo pq:
</p><pre>S(x) = x<sup>d</sup>
g(x) = xk<sup>-1</sup>
f(x)= xk<sup>e</sup>
</pre>

We can check that the blind signature property holds:
gSf(m) = (m(k<sup>e</sup>))<sup>d</sup> * k<sup>-1</sup> = 
	m<sup>d</sup> * k * k<sup>-1</sup>
	= m<sup>d</sup>, which is the valid RSA signature of
	    private key d on m.
<p>


</p><h4>          Unlinkable Transfers </h4>
Distinguish between either a counter or third party tracing 
one person's true name, via lack of or weak communications
mix, and a third party linking two entities (whether nyms, 
use-more-than-once-addresses, account numbers, or true names) 
as being involved in the same transaction.   By unlinkability
herein we mean the latter.  The goal where true names are
used (this occurs, for example, when using true name accounts
or not using good communications mixes), is to prevent third
party linking of two people doing business with each other.  Where 
nyms are used the goal is to minimize the release of traffic information, 
to prevent the unwanted accumulation of unique behavior patterns, 
which could be used to link nyms (including to their true names), or 
could augment other means of breaching privacy.  Blinding
especially helps where rights holders want to keep third party
or public accounts denominated in generic rights.  In
that case a communications mix doesn't even in principle
give us what blinding does.  
<p>
Besides protecting against the 
transfer agent, Chaum's transferor-, transferee-, and
double-blinding protocols protect against collusion of 
a party with a transfer agent to identify the countparty 
account or nym.
</p><p>

Unlinkability can be provided by combining 
a list of cleared certificates with blind signatures 
and a delay-mixing effect. Enough instances of a 
standardized contract are issued
over a period of time to create a mix. Between the 
issuing and clearing of a certificate, many other
certificates with the same signature will be cleared, 
making it highly improbable that a particular
clearing can be linked to a particular issue via the 
signature. There is a tradeoff between the mixing
effect and the exposure to the theft of a "plate" for a 
particular issue: the smaller the issue, the
smaller the exposure but the greater the linkability; 
a larger issue has both greater exposure and
greater confidentiality. 
</p><p>
Blind signatures can be used to make certificate 
transfers unlinkable via serial number. Privacy from
the transfer agent can take the form of transferee-
unlinkability, transferor-unlinkability, or "double
blinded" where both transferor and transferee are 
unlinkable by the transfer agent or a collusion of a
transfer agent and counterparty. 
</p><p>
A use-once-address communications mix plus foreswearing
any reputation gain from keeping accounts, in theory also 
buys us unlinkability, but a communications mix
is weak and very expensive. 
</p><p>

Bearer certificates come in an "online" variety, 
cleared during every transfer, and thus both verifiable
and observable, and an "offline" variety, which can 
be transferred without being cleared, but is only
verifiable when finally cleared, by revealing any the 
clearing name of any intermediate holder who
transferred the object multiple times (a breach of 
contract). 
</p><p>

This unlinkability is often called "anonymity", but 
the issue of whether accounts are issued to real
names or pseudonyms, and whether transferor and 
transferee identify themselves to each other, is
orthogonal to unlinkability by the transfer agent in
the online model. In the off-line model, account
identification (or at least a highly reputable and/or 
secured pseudonym) is required: passing an offline
certificate a second time reveals this identity. 
Furthermore, communications channels can allow Eve
to link transferor and transferee, unless they take 
the precaution of using an anonymous remailer.
Online clearing does make lack of identification a 
reasonable option for many kinds of transactions,
although common credit and warrantee situations 
often benefit from or even require identification. 
</p><p>

When confronting an attempted clearing of a 
cleared serial number, we face an error-or-fraud
dilemma similar to the one we encountered above 
in double entry bookkeeping. The ecash(tm)
protocol from DigiCash actually takes advantage of 
on purpose to recover from a network failure. When 
certificates are lost over the net it is not clear
to the transferor whether they have been received 
and cleared by the transferee or not.
Second-transferring directly with the transfer agent 
resolves the ambiguity. This only works with the
online protocol. The issue of distinguishing error 
from fraud is urgent in the offline protocol, but there
is as yet no highly satisfactory solution. This 
problem is often intractable due to the subjectivity of
intent. 
</p><p>

With ideal two-way anonymous communications between use-once
keys, and completely accountless clearing, unlinkability
via blind signatures becomes redundant.  This ideal
case has yet to be even closely approached with 
implemented technology, and necessarily involves long
communications delays which are often intolerable.
Real imperfect communications mixes and less expensive
blinded tokens complement each other.
</p><p>

</p><h4>          Conserved Objects </h4>

Issuance and cleared transfer of references to a
distributed object conserves the usage of that
object. This object becomes "scarce" in economic 
terms, just as use of physical objects is finite.
Conserved objects provide the basis for a software 
economics that more closely resembles
economics of scarce physical objects. Conserved 
objects can be used to selectively exclude not
only scarce physical resources (such as CPU time, 
network bandwidth and response time, etc.), but
also fruits of intellectual labor - as long as one is 
willing to pay the price to interact with that
information over the network rather than locally (cf. 
content rights management). Conservation
immunizes objects and the resources they 
encapsulate to denial of service attacks. Bearer certificate
protocols can be used to transfer references to a 
particular instance or set of instances of an object,
just as they can be used to transfer other kinds of 
standardized rights. 

<p>
To implement a full transaction of payment for 
services, we often need need more than just the
digital cash protocol; we need a protocol that 
guarantees that service will be rendered if payment is
made, and vice versa. Current commercial systems 
use a wide variety of techniques to accomplish
this, such as certified mail, face to face exchange,
reliance on credit history and collection agencies
to extend credit, etc.  I discuss such issues
in my article on 
<a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/formalizing-securing-relationships.html">
smart contracts</a>.


<!-- h4>          Credentials </h4>

A credential is a claim made by one party about 
another. A positive credential is one the second
party would prefer to reveal, such as a degree from 
a prestigious school, while that party would
prefer not to reveal a negative credential such as a 
bad credit rating. 
<p>
A Chaumian credential is a cryptographic protocol 
for proving that one's pseudonym (for example,
the identification number one uses in a health care 
system) possesses credentials issued to one's
other pseudonyms, without revealing linkages 
between these pseudonyms or between pseudonym
and true name. It's based around the is-a-person 
credential the true name credential, used to
prove, without revealing, the linkage between 
pseudonyms, and to prevent the transfer of
pseudonyms between parties.
<p-->

</p><h4>          Generic vs. Specific Rights</h4>
To discuss the mapping between Chaumian certificates
and distributed capabilities as implemented in
for example 
<a href="http://www.erights.org/">E</a>
I introduce some different, 
partly overlapping terminology: generic vs. specific,
exclusive vs. non-, Transfer Agent vs. Provider,
token vs. Swiss number. 
<p>

Rights can be generic or specific.  Generic rights correspond 
to a class of objects, specific rights to an instance.  So 
a specific right is implemented with a Swiss number, a 
large random number.  The signed numbers corresponding to 
generic rights I will call "tokens". </p><p>

Rights can also be exclusive or non-exlusive.  Any object 
which must be conserved, or finally allocated to a specific 
user, is "exclusive". 
</p><p>

Simple example: the right to an exclusive lock on some 1 MB of 
memory is generic and exclusive.  The right to an exclusive lock 
on the specific address space 100-101 is specific and exclusive.
The right to two dozen particular stock quotes at 12:22 p.m.
today is specific and non-exclusive.
</p><p>

The main motivation for these distinctions are different
mechanisms of unlinkable transfer of these rights, set
out below.
</p><p>

For simplicity generic rights are all "use-once": the life cycle 
of a token consists of issuance, followed by a series of transfers, 
followed by consumption.   More sophisticated life cycles,
such as alternating transfer and consumption, are likely possible
with some extra protocol.
</p><p>

With a perfect communications mix, including use-once
return addresses, and no reputation building, we wouldn't 
need blinded tokens.  However, communications mixes
are expensive, and we want the option of having certain
public records by which to build reputations, yet do
certain rights transfers privately.  For these reasons,
we should allow clients to blind token transfers
in addition to providing a communications mix.
</p><p>

For inexpensive, unlinkable, and verifiable transfer of 
exclusive generic rights, using blinded tokens, there must be a 
signficant population of interchangable generic rights.   
Such rights bundled with nonexlusive specific rights
can also be cheaply transferred since online clearing
is not required for the latter.  Unlinkable and verifiable 
transfer of exclusive specific rights seems to require online
clearing via an expensive communications mix.
</p><p>

Two kinds of TTPs: a Transfer Agent (TA) and a Provider.  The 
TA operates like an accountless digital cash mint, clearing 
the transfer of tokens for generic rights.  Digital cash is 
a special case: money is the most generic of rights.
</p><p>

The Provider is responsible for actually holding the object, 
which can contain unique state.   The Provider
issues a Swiss number, or better a signed description
of the specific right and its Swiss number.   This
signature allows offline verification of the nonexlusive 
right where the Provider is reputable.  The TA
issues a token for the corresponding generic rights.
</p><p>
Chaum has also developed other means for dealing with
unique state[2].
</p><p>
I'm assuming the TA and Provider have known reputable
signatures.   The trust or reputation  needed to ensure correctness 
of transfer between Provider, TA, and users is partly left for 
later analysis.   The two main goals here are to assure that
users can verify their rights (including exclusivity from
transferors where promised) and retain full privacy from 
TAs and Providers.   Some other trust assumptions are 
likely made here which need to be explicated and analyzed.
</p><p>

To implement exclusive transfers, the TA keeps a list of 
cleared (cancelled) token numbers.   The TA corresponds  
to a "mint" in the Chaumian online digital cash protocol 
(see above).  A class of generic rights corresponds to a 
"denomination" of coin.  The Provider may also keep a list 
of outstanding or used Swiss numbers, like an E Registrar.
</p><p>

Here is another example of a generic right, or class of fungible
objects:  "A queriable SQL database with up to 10 MB of storage, 
and certain standard response time guaruntees".   
</p><p>

The TA sees only classes of fungible objects.  The Provider and
users see particular instances with unique state, for example a database
filled with unique information.   
</p><p>

The Provider acts analogously to a "shop".  It is just another token
client to the TA, which like other clients can transfer or receive tokens.  
Its special role is that it is responsible for issuance, where it
tells the TA about a new instance, obtains a new token,
and transfers it to the client to whom the new generic right
is being issued.  The TA generates and destroys token 
supply only at the behest of the Provider; otherwise all its
transfers conserve the supply of a particular generic right.  The 
Provider is also responsible for the delivery of service to the 
client bearing the promised right(s), at which time the Provider 
"deposits" the generic token(s), instructing the TA to decrement 
the token supply.  In digital cash terminology, the Provider is
the only entity which has to keep something like a bank account.  
Rights holders can also keep an account, if they wish to use it to 
help build reputation, or they can just use the TA for accountless 
conserved rights transfer.
</p><p>

The Provider issues along with the initial generic rights token
a signed affadavit, machine or human readable, describing
aspects of the object which may be non-exlusive and
unique, along with that instance's Swiss number and the
public key(s) of the generic right(s) for which it is valid.    
For example, it  might say  "a database containing quotes 
of these two dozen listed stocks as of 12:22 pm Monday", without 
actually containing those quotes.  Often such description is worth
more when bundled with generic exclusive rights, such as the right 
to a fast response time.  The specific rights can elaborate in unique 
ways upon the generic rights, as long as these elaborations are not 
taken to define exclusive rights.  The generic rights let the
TAs garuntee exclusivity to users and conservation of resources to 
Providers, while the specific rights describe the unique state to 
any desired degree of elaboration.   The Provider must be
prepared to service any specific promise it has issued, as long 
as it is accompanied by the proper conserved generic tokens.
</p><p>

This method of composing specific and generic rights, transferred 
as a bundle but with exlusive generic atoms cleared by different 
TAs, allows arbitrarily sophisticated rights bundles, referring
to objects with arbitrarily unique state, to be transferred
unlinkably.  A wide variety of derivatives and combinations are
possible.  The only restriction is that obtaining rights to 
specific exclusive resources must either be deferred to the 
consumption phase, or transferred with online clearing
via expensive communications mix.
</p><p>

If the Provider wished to garuntee exclusivity to a specific
right, transfer seems to require an expensive communications
mix  between Provider and transferee, rather than a cheap
blinded token.    For example, "Deep Space Station
60 from 0500-0900 Sunday" or "a  lock on autoexec.bat now"
demands exclusivity to a specific right, and thus seems
to require a communications mix to unlinkably transfer.
On the other hand, "A one hour block on DSS-60 in May"
and "the right to lock autoexec.bat at some point" are 
generic and can be transferred privately with the much
less expensive blinding, given a sufficient population
of other tokens for this class of generic right transfered
between the issuance and consumption of a given token.
</p><p>

Clients can deal with the TA without a communications
mix. They deal with the Provider via a communications
mix.  If both the initial and final holders failed to do this,
the Provider could link them.   If just the final holder failed
to do so,  the Provider could identify him as the actual user of 
the resource.  Thus for full privacy generic transfers are cheap, 
and nonexclusive transfers are cheap, while specific exsclusive
transfers and actually using the object seem to require
the expensive communications mix.
