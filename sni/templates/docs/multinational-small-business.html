Currently the vast majority of businesses on the planet are small, but 
the vast bulk of multinational business is conducted by large corporations.  
</p><p>
In the future the size distribution of multinationals will approach that 
of local business. The phase change between these states may be quite 
rapid as telecomm and transport costs pass through a "melting point",
creating a wide variety of new multinational small businesses, and
industries to support those businesses.

</p><p>
Barriers to multinational small business include
</p><p>
	</p><li> 
<a href="http://freenet.vcu.edu/science/lawtech/intl.html">
legal: prohibitively complex maze of jurisdictions </a> </li><br>
	<li> language/culture </li><br>
	<li> telecomm costs </li><br>
	<li> transport costs </li><br>

<p>
Both transport and telecomm costs have become unprecedentedly low, and 
with fiber optics telecomm costs will drop orders of magnitude further.  

</p><p>
Small business can cut through the 
<a href="http://www.replay.com/cpunk/cptext.html"> Gordian knot of jurisdictions</a>
with the technologies of jurisdictional independence, including strong 
encryption for communications and databases, digital cash, firewalls, 
foiling of traffic analysis with proxy servers and digital mixes, and 
other system security measures.  For use of these capabilities to become 
routine they must be made seamlessly available in the telecommunications 
equipment and software used by small business.  In their commercial 
dealings, businesses will increasingly deal with industry specific
dispute arbitrators rather than traditional legal jurisdictions, 
and auditing information from transactions will be shared only between 
the parties necessary to resolve the dispute.  Businesses will learn 
to share the information needed to attract investment and sales,
only to those investors and customers, without jeopardizing their legal
status in any major market in the maze of obscure jurisdictions they operate
in.  The companies that first bring these capabilities to international 
small business at affordable prices stand to reap large fortunes.  The
new paradigm of <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html">smart contracts</a> may provide the cornerstone for 
building these tools.

</p><p>
Once jurisdictional indepdence is won, small business has nearly endless 
opportunities to arbitrage between the relative strengths and weaknesses 
of various localities in various aspects of their business, much
like multinationals currently take advantage of relaxed regulatory
burdens and low labor costs in Third World countries now.
Government intervention probably costs the global economy over
$3 trillion U.S. dollars annually; thus vast markets wait to be cracked
open by short-circuiting the intervention of governments in both macro 
and micro markets.

</p><p>
Language and culture may remain the largest barriers.  Two methods 
of attack:

</p><p>
* The rise of virtual nations.  Multinational small businesses
might speak entirely English, Japanese, Mandarin, etc.  Their
employees might live primarily within a single cultural milieu,
dispersed thru a large number of small ethnic communities around 
the world, keeping close culture-specific, multimedia communications 
links between the communities.  The worldwide Anglo, Japanese, and 
Mandarin business networks will be taken up by other cultures, and 
physically dispersed in most cases.

</p><p>
* Language-translation software.  Crude, specialized versions
might soon be reliable, convenient, and inexpensive enough for many 
kinds of small business uses, such as translating technical manuals.

</p><p>
* English is becoming increasingly the _de facto_ language for
business and technology.

</p><p>
One interesting question is what small changes might bring about the 
phase change faster.  Something as simple as a user-friendly voice
teleconferencing system, might be enough to tip the penguins into the 
water.  Or it might be widespread Internet access with encrypted, 
route-mixed TCP/IP connections and virtual whiteboards.

</p><p>
Another interesting question in any major new trend is what will be the
bottleneck pieces.  With the clonable PC, Intel's CPUs and
Microsoft's DOS turned out to be the only proprietary elements,
with assembly, disk drives, terminals, and the like highly 
competitive.   Wealth will flow to the businesses that provide
the bottleneck tools for the coming explosion in multinational small 
business.

</p><p>
The flip side of multinational small business is setting
up
