<b><big>Abstract</big></b>
</p>
<p align="justify"><i>
  Describing digital value for payment systems
  is not a trivial task.
  Simplistic methods of using numbers or country
  codes to describe currencies, and ticker tape
  symbols to issue bonds, shares, and other financial
  instruments soon run into shortcomings in their
  ability to handle dynamic and divergent demands.

  The seemingly arbitrary variations in the
  meanings of different instruments are best
  captured as contracts between issuers and
  holders.

  Thus, the digital issuance of instruments
  can be viewed as the issuance of contracts.
</i>  </p>

  <p align="justify"><i>
  This paper proposes that the <i>contract
  is the issue</i>.
  A document form is described that encompasses the
  inherent contractual nature of the financial
  instrument yet copes with the requirements
  of being an integral part of a payment system.

<h2> 1. <a href="#index" name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p align="justify">
Little work has been done on classification
and description of value in the
field of financial cryptography.
This paper presents the Ricardian Contract,
a method to identify
and describe issues of financial instruments
as contracts

    <small>[<a href="#ref_1" name="back_1">1</a>]</small>.
It was originally developed by
Ian Grigg and Gary Howland
as part of the Ricardo payment system.
</p>

<h3> 1.1. <a href="#index" name="i_origins">The Origins</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
The original application was a bond trading system
    <small>[<a href="#ref_2" name="back_2">2</a>]</small>.
For trading, a
basic component is a transfer or payment system
which receives and acts on
transfer instructions to move instruments
(cash, bonds) from one account to another.
Each instruction therefore must identify the instrument.
</p>

<p align="justify">
A means was required to capture, identify, and
describe the traded instruments.
There are thousands of bonds, and potentially
millions of other instruments that could be
issued and traded, and each has unique
characteristics that are not amenable to
compression into databases.
To such a system, cash is no different to bonds,
and requires the same description.
</p>


<h3> 1.2. <a href="#index" name="i_problem">The Problem</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
When someone issues a currency
(or bond or share)
over the Internet, what is it?
What does the recipient have?
</p>

<p align="justify">
Few systems for issuance of value (payment systems)
treat these questions adequately.
They generally refer to existing external units
of currency and tidy up loose edges in a
<i>user agreement</i>.
For example, Paypal, an issuer of dollars,
relies on the familiarity of the US dollar
to define much of its service offering.
Gold issuers lean more heavily on their user
agreements as the metal unit is not so
familiar.
</p>

<p align="justify">
For trading, it is not sufficient
to refer to well-known familiar references,
as each instrument is different in finicky ways
and these differences matter to traders.
Even with currencies, however, the user has
difficulty in determining the security and
safety of one dollar with respect to another.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Classification by numbers or symbols
is a starting point.
Almost all systems of digital issuance
identify their basic issue by allocating
numbers or letters as currencies
(for example, 840, "USD", "AUG"
    <small>[<a href="#ref_3" name="back_3">3</a>]</small>).

These systems runs into trouble quickly.
</p>

<p align="justify">
An issuer with many currencies or many
issuers with the same nominal
currency raises difficult questions.
Can an issuer have two
or more dollar units?
For example, within ISO3166-1, there are
three different US dollars:
    840/USD (<i>cash</i>),
    998/USS (<i>same day</i>), and
    997/USN (<i>next day</i>).
Similarly, how does one Digital Gold Currency
("DGC") differentiate his gold over that of
another issuer, when all are known as "AUG"?
</p>


<h3> 1.3. <a href="#index" name="i_solution">The Solution</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
As bonds are, at their essence, contracts
between issuers and users, our problem
reduces to one of <i>issuing contracts</i>.
Whereas other issues <i>have</i> contracts,
our issues <i>are</i> contracts.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Our innovation is to express an issued instrument as
a contract, and to link that contract into every
aspect of the payment system.
By this process, a document of some broad
utility (readable by user and program) is drafted and
digitally signed by the issuer of the instrument.
This document, the
<i>Ricardian Contract</i>,
forms the basis for understanding
an issue and every transaction within that issue.
</p>

<p align="justify">
By extension, all issues of value, such as
currencies, shares, derivatives, loyalty systems
and vouchers, can benefit from this approach.
</p>


<h3> 1.4. <a href="#index" name="i_structure">Structure</a></h3>


<p align="justify">
This paper is structured as follows.
In Section 2,
we discuss conventional approaches to
identifying and describing issuance,
and explore questions and doubts
surrounding these approaches.
Then, in Section 3, a design to express issuance as
a contract is presented.
Finally, in Section 4, concluding remarks are added.
</p>


<h2> 2. <a href="#index" name="class">Issues of Value as Contracts</a></h2>


<h3> 2.1. <a href="#index" name="c_first">A First Generation Scheme</a></h3>


<p align="justify">
Consider the case of the pioneering
digital cash scheme, eCash, 
as originally fielded by DigiCash BV.
The first valuable currency,
issued by Mark Twain Bank of the USA,
was identified with the number 4.
Lore has it that the early system allocated
a small sequential number to each currency.
Test systems had already acquired
0,1,2,3 and thus 4 was the next.
DigiCash's marketing assumptions then changed
to assume one issue per country.
In time, this scheme was adjusted to
issue currencies numbered after
international dialling codes
(e.g., 49 for Germany, 61 for Australia).
The shortfalls of this scheme became apparent,
so a new design was created
    <small>[<a href="#ref_4" name="back_4">4</a>]</small>.
One 32 bit number to describe the issue was used,
on the pragmatic assumption that this would be
large enough to cover foreseeable eventualities.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Yet the strains of <i>one issuer, one currency</i>
were obvious almost immediately.
A more advanced scheme could use a tuple of
(<i>issuer</i>, <i>currency</i>)
to describe a system whereby each issuer
is empowered in some sense to issue multiple
competing currencies
    <small>[<a href="#ref_5" name="back_5">5</a>]</small>.
It is easy to generalise this system by adding
additional elements to the tuple:
(<i>issuer</i>, <i>type</i>, <i>identifier</i>) tuple
    <small>[<a href="#ref_6" name="back_6">6</a>]</small>.
For example, a zero coupon bond issued by the
Joint Universal and Nationwide Keiretsu
that pays out in January of 2100
might have a tuple of (JUNK, zero, Jan_2100).
</p>


<h3> 2.2. <a href="#index" name="c_numbers">The Trouble with Numbers</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
Numbers as a space for identifying
digital instruments are limiting,
and having tuples as an extension
is not really an answer.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Firstly, what do they describe?
    In the case of electronic cash systems,
    they can describe currencies and issuers.
    Is it one or both, and
    how do we generalise to other aspects?

    Secondly, what surety do we have that what
    is described is accurate?
    Whilst a lot can be achieved by simply
    relying on the reputation
    of the issuer, financial
    insiders know that the
    real value is expressed in the
    detail and the reliability
    of the claim.

    Thirdly, how are the numbers derived?
    Is a central registry required,
    or can any issuer of digital value
    acquire a number as per local requirements?

    Finally, is there a limit to the space?
    Integer numbers as expressed in
    packets are generally limited to
    some quantity of bits, such as 32.
    For practical software engineering,
    there need to be limits, but do these
    limits need to limit the business possibilities?
</p>


<h3> 2.3. <a href="#index" name="c_grandma">The Challenge of Success</a></h3>


<p align="justify">
Any successful system will be used in ways
that make it appear to be broken.
As software engineers, we need to
present our inventions with the humility of
toolmakers for future generations of builders,
not as bureaucrats planning the zoning of
the digital commerce space.
</p>

<p align="justify">
What happens when
we have gone through the early adopters,
dominated the moms and pops, and competition is
fiercely turning onto our elderly retired set?
Imagine mints in the pockets of
billions of idle game-playing senior citizens.
Or, imagine a world with an issuer of
digital loyalty points on every parking meter, or
where students must pay for tuition with
shares of future earnings.
Already we have seen popular musicians
selling bonds backed by their music
    <small>[<a href="#ref_7" name="back_7">7</a>]</small>,
and proposals for software bug fixes financed
by securitized issues to anonymous users
    <small>[<a href="#ref_8" name="back_8">8</a>]</small>.
</p>


<h3> 2.4. <a href="#index" name="c_zero">The Zero Coupon Bond</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
Consider the zero coupon bond,
an instrument that pays a <i>face value</i>
of a currency on a given date.
The <i>zero</i> is perhaps the simplest general
financial instrument in common use, and it
formed the benchmark for our design.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To describe
the face value, the currency of the face value,
and the expiry date of this bond,
we would add additional elements to the above tuple.
But this is only a beginning.
In his description of Eurobonds,
Noel Clarke expects dozens or hundreds of fields
    <small>[<a href="#ref_9" name="back_9">9</a>]</small>.
If we examine just
one of these characteristics, for example
<i>Event-Related Put Options</i>,
we find that a bond needs to describe
what happens in the event of:
</p>

  <li> a hostile or friendly takeover of the issuer,
  </li><li> a takeover by the issuer of another party,
  </li><li> a recapitalisation,
  </li><li> a repurchase program by the issuer
       of its own shares, or
  </li><li> a distribution of assets above a
       certain percentage of the issue's net worth.

<p align="justify">
These items bind tightly to the instrument
in question, but they represent difficulties
to the software architect.
We can make a  number of observations.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Firstly, each event is not simple.
Today,
one may be able to shoehorn the notion of
"a hostile or friendly takeover" into a single
name-value pair,
but this would not survive the evolving scene
of regulation and litigation that applies to
such events.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Secondly, there is no reason to believe that
the above list is complete.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Thirdly, not only is it going to be hard to
design a single field of any sort to cope
with these, they are mostly going
to be full of legal text.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Consider a data layout point of view.
To describe the document
that forms the basis of a bond
we will need a tree-structured
database of tuples, as a minimum.
More, that layout
is only going to work for one instrument,
or one extremely tight, nearly fungible set
of instruments.
</p>

<h3> 2.5. <a href="#index" name="c_cash">Cash is King</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
Currencies, or cash, might be that tight set.
After all, a dollar is a dollar is a dollar.
Can we describe money with some simple set
of tuples?
Even for cash, we argue that a layout of
tuples is not sufficient.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Take the case of a digital dollar issued by a bank.
The digital dollars would be derivatives,
often backed by deposits in the same amount.
This may be sufficient for marketing purposes
but it would not survive a serious financial
analysis.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Compare such derivative dollars to those
issued by the US Federal Reserve
Board.
The Fed has yet to deny acceptance of
its notes if presented with same,
if only as a claim on another bunch of
the same instrument, or for taxation liabilities.
Radical interpretations aside, the
Fed has never filed for bankruptcy
and remains a pretty solid bet.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The same cannot be said of just any
bank issuer of derivative dollars.
Its digital dollars would be backed by deposits with
... the very same institution.
Such a bank can close its doors at any time,
and, given the history of the banking sector
in the 20th Century, an analyst should take this
risk seriously.  Further, in the USA at least,
the FDIC has already ruled that funds so held on a
user's PC are considered to be uninsured deposits
    <small>[<a href="#ref_10" name="back_10">10</a>]</small>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This is not to suggest that any given bank
is about to close doors, but to ask
what happens when an issuer does indeed
default on its promise?
</p>
 
<p align="justify">
Any holder of any asset will carry a risk.
A holder of electronic dollars will carry
the risk that the issuer fails, and the holder
of another issuer's dollars carries a similar,
comparable, but <i>distinct</i> risk.
Each of those risks result in a cost, which should
be subtracted from the face value of the dollar to
calculate a comparative value.
In this risk distinction lies the inescapable
fact that any given dollar is not of constant value,
even when measured against some well-known dollar
such as that issued by the Federal Reserve.
</p>



<h3> 2.6. <a href="#index" name="c_fine">The Fine Print of the Contract</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
If there is no such thing as a single dollar,
what is left?  Clearly, we must describe each
and every dollar for what it is.
This would seem to be a task of
fine print and detail, and, indeed,
<i>
every distinct issued currency
is a distinct contract
between the issuer and the holder.
</i>
</p>


<p align="justify">


A contract can encapsulate the detail.
Consider the original sovereign currency contracts,
in which the issuer
promised to pay the bearer
in ounces of precious metal.
That is four datum in the contract already:
  which sovereign,
  "pay to bearer,"
  what to pay, and
  how much of it.
</p>

<p align="justify">
So it is with every bond, every currency, and any
financial instrument of any complexity

In fact, within the digital domain, the question
of how to treat a financial instrument
reduces in great part to how to
treat a contract.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Or, an issue <i>is</i> a contract.
Issues within other payment systems
have contracts but only as adjunct
documents such as user agreements.
Often, their role and importance
is subject to battles;  Marketing
wants them hidden, while Legal
asks for them to be thrust
in the user's face at all times.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Once we accept that the issue is a contract,
the task becomes simple:  create a contract
that can be linked into the payment system
as the centerpiece.
That is the subject of the next section.
</p>


<h2> 3. <a href="#index" name="design">A Digital Contracts System for Issuance </a></h2>


<p align="justify">
Almost all aspects of Ricardian Contracts
are best seen by examining examples,
and this section only briefly covers the
salient details, before discussing the
ramifications.
Examples can be found at
<a href="http://webfunds.org/ricardo/contracts/">
webfunds.org/ricardo/contracts/</a> .
</p>

<h3> 3.1. <a href="#index" name="d_defn">Definition</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
A Ricardian Contract can be defined as
a single document that is
a) a contract offered by an issuer to holders,
b) for a valuable right held by holders,
   and managed by the issuer,
c) easily readable by people (like a contract on paper),
d) readable by programs (parsable like a database),
e) digitally signed,
f) carries the keys and server information, and
g) allied with a unique and secure identifier.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the simplest possible terms, a Ricardian Contract
is a document defining a type of value for issuance
over the Internet
    <small>[<a href="#ref_11" name="back_11">11</a>]</small>.
It identifies the Issuer, being the signatory,
and any terms and clauses the Issuer sees fit
to add in to make the document stand as a contract.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The same document has to be both readable
by people and parsable by programs.
The Ricardian Contract is formatted as a text file
that can be easily read (displayed or printed),
and programs can convert it into internal forms
for searching for name-value pairs.
It includes a special section for each type
of contract, such as bond, share, currency, etc.
Further sections within describe, in program-parsable
terms, usage of decimal points, titles, and symbols.
</p>

<p align="justify">
As legal signatory, the Issuer signs the document
in the OpenPGP cleartext form with his contract
signing key
    <small>[<a href="#ref_12" name="back_12">12</a>]</small>.

He includes the full chain of OpenPGP keys
within the document to permit programs to
directly verify and authenticate.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To uniquely identify the contract,
any user can calculate a
<i>canonical message digest</i>
over the clearsigned document.
This message digest is included in
all records of transactions, and provides a secure
(unforgeable) link from the document to the
accounting of the issue.
</p>


<p align="justify">
E.g.,
<small>e3b445c2a6d82df81ef46b54d386da23ce8f3775</small>
is the full message digest for
Systemics Inc's issue of prepaid
services dollars.
Commonly called a hash, the message digest
is a cryptographic technique
to create a relatively small number that is
one to one with the document.  That is, for
each document, there is only one hash, and the
hash refers uniquely to that document.
The algorithm is the well-known standard, SHA1.
</p>





<h3> 3.2. <a href="#index" name="d_extra">Some Observations</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
The following observations highlight
how strong the result is.
</p>


<p align="justify">
    <b>Hash Limits Frog-Boiling.</b>

    A gradual change in contract by the stronger
    party over time is known as <i>frog-boiling</i>.
    The stronger party is generally the issuer,
    and can be expected to change the contract
    if there is a benefit.  This is a frequent attack.

    One result of the use of the hash identifier
    is that neither party can change the contract
    arbitrarily or surreptitiously.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    To see this is true, we need to examine
    the records that refer to the hash.

    An application can sign all important
    records (e.g., payments, tokens, receipts,
    balances), and these signed records
    include the hash of a Ricardian Contract.

    The hash within the record cannot be changed
    without losing its ability to pass a test of
    signature validity.
    Likewise, the contract cannot be changed without
    losing its relationship to records already
    signed and delivered.

    In other words, every record, held by every user,
    incorporates an unalterable copy of that hash. 
    Any change to the contract creates a new hash,
    and that new hash is not the one which the users
    have or value.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    This crystallises the contract for both parties,
    stopping the stronger
    party from modifying the contract subtly at
    some later stage.
    To some extent, this redresses the imbalance
    of power between provider and customer in the
    offering of a form contract.  The lesser party
    has no option to negotiate, but neither has the
    greater party the option to claim a distinct
    contract at a later time.
    The limitation comes at some cost as it can
    be a nuisance for the support team of that
    financial instrument.
</p>

<p align="justify">
</p>


<p align="justify">
<b>The Ricardian PKI Delivers Clarity.</b>
    Ricardian Contracts carry their own Public
    Key Infrastructure ("PKI") with them.
    The Issuer's top level public key is included in the
    contract, and it signs his contract-signing key,
    also included.
    The contract-signing key signs the contract itself.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    This achieves several things.
    Firstly, client software can check
    the entire digital signature chain 
    in one automated sequence.


</p>

<p align="justify">
    Secondly, there is no need for a complex
    multi-party PKI.  All the keys are present,
    and there is no need to go looking for them
    on the net.
    This eliminates substitution attacks, whereby
    a key that might pass some checks could be
    inserted in some key lookup phase.
    It also reduces costs dramatically.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Thirdly,
    the canonical hash of the contract also represents a
    signature on the contract.  It is recorded
    in all relevant records, and thus entangles
    the contract with those activities

    <small>[<a href="#ref_13" name="back_13">13</a>]</small>.

    Once the contract has been in play for a while,
    it establishes its provenance through presence
    and reliance by the user public.  This provides
    far more persuasive evidence than the issuer's
    signature itself;  once the issuer and the public
    have spent time and money relying on the contract,
    via the hash, it is hard for the issuer to renege
    on the nature of the contract or his signature.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The result is a PKI that delivers strong
    end-to-end reliability, based on a single document.
    This is simply not present in other designs for PKIs
    <small>[<a href="#ref_14" name="back_14">14</a>]</small>.
    This reliability pays off in the dispute resolution
    phase, where, we suggest, the Ricardian Contract
    can stand alone on its merits and requires no
    complex descriptions of PKI, digital signatures,
    or references to uncertain third parties
    to bolster its provenance.
    By including the keys, we can draw a couple of
    simple lines within the contract, asserting
    "this key signs that key, and that latter signs the
    contract.  The first key is the top-level key of
    the individual that signed this contract.
    That's the whole story, mi'lud."
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Validating the Issuer's Key.</b>
All good crypto protocols divide into two parts,
the first of which says to the second,
"trust this key completely."
</p>

<p align="justify">
The top-level key of the Issuer ultimately
authenticates the contract.  The keys and
other information in the contract also permit
a protocol such as SOX to bootstrap a
strongly secured connection to the server
    <small>[<a href="#ref_15" name="back_15">15</a>]</small>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
How then to verify that
this ultimate key is really the Issuer's?
This is not difficult.  The business
process of digital issuance involves
a great deal of
relationship-building between Issuers
and Users.  Many different interactions
involve chances to establish trust.
For example, from his web site, the Issuer 
can publish the contract, keys and hashes,
and have other sites mirror them.
The value so issued will be distributed
via payments that include the hash.
An already trusted party usually delivers
these payments.
The payments validly identify the contract,
and derive their own validity,
via the hash.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Contrast this to assumptions in the
x.509 PKI behind SSL/HTTPS browsing
(the following is highly debatable, but
is presented for comparison only).
In that PKI, it was originally claimed that a
user would present her credit card to sites
with which she had no prior relationship
and no way for her to establish the provenance
of the site's key.  Thus, a trusted third party,
the Certificate Authority,
was put in place to confirm the key.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Payments, trading and matters of finance are
fundamentally relationship-rich.
The nature of money and finance is that
participants always conduct their own due diligence,
they prefer to listen to peers they already trust,
and do not
readily accept the word of an independent party.
Thus, there is no place for a central third party
to stand in and authenticate players.
Before the user desires to place any
value on a given payment, she has almost
certainly been made aware of the contract
via other means.
</p>


<p align="justify">
<b>Presumption of Possession.</b>
The use of the hash as an identifier is a compromise
as it is unintelligible to humans
    <small>[<a href="#ref_16" name="back_16">16</a>]</small>.
Yet this very compromise delivers an
unexpected benefit:


    <i>Use of the issue leads to a presumption
    that the user has the contract.</i>


    To use an issue of value, such as a currency, the
    user must have the hash in the applicable records.
    That is, if the user receives a payment,
    that payment record will include the hash.
    As the hash is not descriptive,
    this implies that the user has the contract
    in order to interpret the issue.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    To see that this is true,
    imagine having a record with the hash
    but without having the contract.
    The first thing the user
    will need is a database of
    parameters telling her what
    the hash refers to.
    Unlike a payment in 10 of "GBP",
    a payment of 1000 in "972097bb..."
    is not intelligible.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Yet how could software predict what
    the user needs to know about the hash?
    Very quickly
    it becomes apparent that the software
    is better off storing the source of
    the information - the full contract
    itself - as it removes
    an unlimited degree of complexity
    in storing intermediate or secondary
    information.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Software can still function with
    only the hash.  However, it
    would be entirely blind to the
    semantics of the instrument.
    Such a cavalier approach might be acceptable for
    communications and storage, but for user software,
    it is equivalent to a traumatic failure.
    To cope with this, the client-side
    software takes especial care to
    acquire and keep contracts.
    Hence, we can state the presumption
    with some degree of confidence:
    in a functioning system,
    the user has available the
    full Ricardian Contract
    (albeit under software control).
</p>

<p align="justify">
    This is only a small step for the client software,
    but is a giant leap forward for the relationship
    between the issuer and the holder.  Specifically,
    having a strong presumption that the user
    has the full contract available will simplify
    many legal
    aspects about the issuer's responsibilities.
    (We suggest and thus acknowledge
    the legal ramifications of the term
    <i>presumption</i>,
    but neither space nor expertise permits
    more in this paper.)
</p>



<h3> 3.3. <a href="#index" name="c_4c">The Four Corners of the Page</a></h3>

<p align="justify">
The Ricardian Contract delivers a rich
source of primary, complete information.
The full story is right there in textual form,
in parsable parameters, and in
the signature chain.
Thus, within a dispute,
a hostile legal attack has less room
to manoeuvre, and can only confirm the facts
as laid out in the contract.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Our intent is that the contract is the
beginning and the end of the discussion;
we call this principle <i>the rule of one contract</i>.
The legal fraternity refers to
"the contract being bounded by
<i>the four corners of the page</i>."
By showing how we have carefully
laid out a readable document,
with a verifiable digital signature, and
an unforgeable identifier linking to every record,
we can more readily ask the judiciary to
accept that the single document which is
being presented is indeed
the valid contract agreed to by the parties.
</p>




<h2> 4. <a href="#index" name="conc">Conclusion</a></h2>


<p align="justify">
The contract is the keystone of issuance
    <small>[<a href="#ref_17" name="back_17">17</a>]</small>.

Our innovation is to express all the salient
details of an issuance as an unforgeable contract,
unforgeably linked into every action within a
payment system.  In this
way, financial innovation can develop along
the lines it always has done - by means of
innovation within contracts.
By translating the institution of the
contract into the digital domain,
we build upon centuries' and even millenia'
worth of experience in documenting, sharing
and disputing the meaning of agreements between
parties.
</p>

<h3> 4.1. <a href="#index" name="c_comp">The Challenge of Complexity</a></h3>


<p align="justify">
To capture complexity, we can put documents such as
contracts into electronic form and sign them using
digital signature technologies such as OpenPGP.
The result is a reasonable analogue of the paper
and ink contracts that most people and businesses
are familiar with, bolstered with cryptographic
integrity.
</p>

<p align="justify">
With the hash as the identifier,
software can now uniquely
identify a given financial arrangement and
can confirm a strong chain of signatures.
The hash strongly implies
the user has the contract available at all times,
and it cannot be changed
without being noticed.
</p>


<p align="justify">
The Ricardian Contract delivers one huge benefit
to the issuer - clarity in many legal and customer
support questions.
The user benefits from lower overall costs,
and better presentation of information,
within a more consistent framework.
</p>


<h3> 4.2. <a href="#index" name="c_lessons"> Lessons Learnt </a></h3>

<p align="justify">
The form has been in successful use since 1996.
Since that time, it has delivered about 20
financial instruments without failure.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Disputes.</b>
The Ricardian Contract
has appeared in two distinct forums of dispute
resolution to resolve claims
    <small>[<a href="#ref_18" name="back_18">18</a>]</small>.
Anecdotally,
each claim was resolved directly and efficiently,
and without undue fuss, simply by referring to the
applicable Ricardian Contract.

</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Automation.</b>
Relatively little has needed to be automated.
In practice, fields have been inserted and
standardised so that programs can extract
decimalisation (dollars versus cents),
labels for units (USD versus $),
and titles for the issuer and the issue.
In contrast to expectations, there
has been no demand to parse every field.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Cost.</b>
The cost of the concept has compared favourably
with that incurred with other payment systems.
The preparation of the contract text carries
some costs, but no more so than a user agreement.
OpenPGP infrastructure requirements
(keys and signing) add some minor costs to
issuers but they are easily offset by the benefits of
risk reduction from contract distribution.
Custom signing editors have helped to reduce
those costs

    <small>[<a href="#ref_19" name="back_19">19</a>]</small>.
</p>



<h3> 4.3. <a href="#index" name="c_fut"> Challenges for the Future </a></h3>

<p align="justify">
<b>Layering.</b>
Layering of contracts is an impending need.
Many businesses can take a standard and defined
set of terms and draw on them directly.
Other contracts result from earlier contracts
and need to reference them.
</p>


<p align="justify">
<b>XML.</b>
Initial efforts suggested that XML would break the
rule of one contract, but it seems that we will
need something better than the archaic INI
format
    <small>[<a href="#ref_20" name="back_20">20</a>]</small>.

One recent proposal, the XML Voucher, stops
short of presenting itself as a contract
    <small>[<a href="#ref_21" name="back_21">21</a>]</small>.


</p>


<p align="justify">
<b>Law of Contract.</b>
The treatment of the Ricardian Contract as
a <i>contract</i>
may raise more legal questions than it answers.
For example, is this form indeed a contract?
How do distinct jurisidictions view the
concept (common law, civil law, UCC, Koranic code)?
Is this a negotiated or a form contract?
When did the user accept the contract?
How strong, or rebuttable, is the presumption
that the user has the contract?
</p>



<p align="justify">
<b>Smart Contracts.</b>
    By unifying all information in a program-readable
    file, there is the enhanced potential of smart
    contracts
    <small>[<a href="#ref_22" name="back_22">22</a>]</small>.
We have not gone further in this direction
than methods to handle decimals.
This is partly for lack of demand, and
partly because it is not clear how a court
would treat a computer program presented
as a contract.
