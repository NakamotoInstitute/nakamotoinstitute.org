_Gradually, Then Suddenly_ is a framework for understanding bitcoin as money. The mistake most people make is never endeavoring to begin the journey, thinking that bitcoin is too difficult to understand to even try in the first place. Bitcoin ultimately solves the problems of printing money, and it is not an IQ test. _Gradually, then Suddenly_ is designed to help anyone curious about bitcoin develop an intuitive understanding, in a way that is accessible to a non-technical audience.

By the end, the reader will have the foundation to think through all the confounding questions about bitcoin, with linear and logical thought processes. The only way to consistently arrive at the same conclusion about anything is through reason and logic, and the same is true about bitcoin. The reader will come away with answers to the questions as to why bitcoin exists and how it works, enough so to credibly apply their own logic and to reach their own conclusions about whether bitcoin really does obsolete all other money.

After starting out on Wall St. during the Great Financial Crisis, Parker Lewis pursued a career in restructuring before working for a hedge fund in Dallas, Texas. It was there Lewis went down the bitcoin rabbit hole. Combining his knowledge of the legacy financial system with an economics degree from Duke University and first-hand experience building a bitcoin custody and financial services business, Lewis has a unique lens through which to frame ideas relating the new world (bitcoin) to the old world (fiat). Lewis writes from first principles based on his experience in the market, both as an investor and entrepreneur. This book explains the reason and logic which has informed why he allocates his own personal savings to bitcoin and ultimately his decision to devote his professional career to bitcoin.
