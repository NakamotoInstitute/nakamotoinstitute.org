A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would\nallow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another\nwithout the burdens of going through a financial institution.\nDigital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main\nbenefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent\ndouble-spending.  We propose a solution to the double-spending\nproblem using a peer-to-peer network.  The network timestamps\ntransactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based\nproof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without\nredoing the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as\nproof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came\nfrom the largest pool of CPU power.  As long as honest nodes control\nthe most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest\nchain and outpace any attackers.  The network itself requires\nminimal structure.  Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis,\nand nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the\nlongest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they\nwere gone.\n\nFull paper at:\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\n\nThe bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\n\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. \n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

The requirement is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single attacker. \n\nThere would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overpower the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.  The smaller farms are then the \"honest nodes\".  (I need a better term than \"honest\")  The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.  According to the \"long tail\" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.\n\nEven if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's instantly rich.  All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check.  To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back.  I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins.  With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.\n\nThe Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

To see if a\ncoin transfer is OK, they report it to one or more new\ncoin issuers and see if the new coin issuer accepts it.\nNew coin issuers check transfers of old coins so that\ntheir new coins have valid form, and they report the\noutcome of this check so that people will report their\ntransfers to the new coin issuer.\n\nIf someone double spends a coin, and one expenditure is\nreported to one new coin issuer, and the other\nsimultaneously reported to another new coin issuer, then\nboth issuers to swifly agree on a unique sequence order\nof payments.  This, however, is a non trivial problem of\na massively distributed massive database, a notoriously\ntricky problem, for which there are at present no peer\nto peer solutions.  Obiously it is a solvable problem,\npeople solve it all the time, but not an easy problem.\nPeople fail to solve it rather more frequently.\n\n  But let us suppose that the coin issue network is\ndominated by a small number of issuers as seems likely.\n\nIf a small number of entities are issuing new coins,\nthis is more resistant to state attack that with a\nsingle issuer, but the government regularly attacks\nfinancial networks, with the financial collapse ensuing\nfrom the most recent attack still under way as I write\nthis.\n\nGovernment sponsored enterprises enter the business, in\ndue course bad behavior is made mandatory, and the evil\nfinancial network is bigger than the honest financial\nnetwork, with the result that even though everyone knows\nwhat is happening, people continue to use the paper\nissued by the evil financial network, because of network\neffects - the big, main issuers, are the issuers you use\nif you want to do business.\n\nThen knowledgeable people complain that the evil\nfinancial network is heading for disaster, that the\ngovernment sponsored enterprises are about to cause a\n\"collapse of the total financial system\", as Wallison\nand Alan Greenspan complained in 2005, the government\ndebates shrinking the evil government sponsored\nenterprises, as with \"S. 190 [109th]: Federal Housing\nEnterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005\" but they find\neasy money too seductive, and S. 190 goes down in flames\nbefore a horde of political activists chanting that easy\nmoney is sound, and opposing it is racist, nazi,\nignorant, and generally hateful, the recent S. 190\ndebate on limiting portfolios (bond issue supporting dud\nmortgages) by government sponsored enterprises being a\nperfect reprise of the debates on limiting the issue of\nnew assignats in the 1790s.\n\nThe big and easy government attacks on money target a\nsingle central money issuer, as with the first of the\nmodern political attacks, the French Assignat of 1792,\nbut in the late nineteenth century political attacks on\nfinancial networks began, as for example the Federal\nreserve act of 1913, the goal always being to wind up\nthe network into a single too big to fail entity, and\nthey have been getting progressively bigger, more\nserious, and more disastrous, as with the most recent\none.  Each attack is hugely successful, and after the\ncataclysm that the attack causes the attackers are\nhailed as saviors of the poor, the oppressed, and the\nnation generally, and the blame for the the bad\nconsequences is dumped elsewhere, usually on Jews,\ngreedy bankers, speculators, etc, because such attacks\nare difficult for ordinary people understand.  I have\ntrouble understanding your proposal - ordinary users\nwill be easily bamboozled by a government sponsored\nsecurity update.  Further, when the crisis hits, to\ndisagree with the line, to doubt that the regulators are\nright, and the problem is the evil speculators, becomes\npolitical suicide, as it did in America in 2007,\nsometimes physical suicide, as in Weimar Germany.\n\nStill, it is better, and more resistant to attack by\ngovernment sponsored enterprises, than anything I have\nseen so far.\n\n > Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or\n > an average of 100 million transactions per day.

It would be\nnice to have the full protocol for big coins, and some\nshortcut for small coins wherein people trust account\nbased money for small amounts till they get wrapped up\ninto big coins.\n\nThe smaller the data storage and bandwidth required for\nmoney issuers, the more resistant the system is the kind\nof government attacks on financial networks that we have\nrecently seen.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

Also, even a fiat currency can \nbe an inflation hedge against another fiat currency's \nhigher rate of inflation.   But in the case of bitcoins \nthe inflation rate of 35% is almost guaranteed by the \ntechnology, there are no supporting mechanisms for \ntaxation, and no legal-tender laws.  People will not \nhold assets in this highly-inflationary currency if \nthey can help it.  \n\n   Bear\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

    "text": "Bitcoin seems to be a very promising idea. I like the idea of basing\nsecurity on the assumption that the CPU power of honest participants\noutweighs that of the attacker. It is a very modern notion that exploits\nthe power of the long tail. When Wikipedia started I never thought it\nwould work, but it has proven to be a great success for some of the\nsame reasons.\n\nI also do think that there is potential value in a form of unforgeable\ntoken whose production rate is predictable and can't be influenced\nby corrupt parties. This would be more analogous to gold than to fiat\ncurrencies. Nick Szabo wrote many years ago about what he called \"bit\ngold\"[1] and this could be an implementation of that concept. There have\nalso been proposals for building light-weight anonymous payment schemes on\ntop of heavy-weight non-anonymous systems, so Bitcoin could be leveraged\nto allow for anonymity even beyond the mechanisms discussed in the paper.\n\nUnfortunately I am having trouble fully understanding the system. The\npaper describes key concepts and some data structures, but does not\nclearly specify the various rules and verifications that the participants\nin the system would have to follow.\n\nIn particular I don't understand exactly what verifications P2P nodes\nperform when they receive new blocks from other nodes, and how they\nhandle transactions that have been broadcast to them. For example, it\nis mentioned that if a broadcast transaction does not reach all nodes,\nit is OK, as it will get into the block chain before long. How does this\nhappen - what if the node that creates the \"next\" block (the first node\nto find the hashcash collision) did not hear about the transaction,\nand then a few more blocks get added also by nodes that did not hear\nabout that transaction? Do all the nodes that did hear it keep that\ntransaction around, hoping to incorporate it into a block once they get\nlucky enough to be the one which finds the next collision?\n\nOr for example, what if a node is keeping two or more chains around as\nit waits to see which grows fastest, and a block comes in for chain A\nwhich would include a double-spend of a coin that is in chain B? Is that\nchecked for or not? (This might happen if someone double-spent and two\ndifferent sets of nodes heard about the two different transactions with\nthe same coin.)\n\nThis kind of data management, and the rules for handling all the packets\nthat are flowing around is largely missing from the paper.\n\nI also don't understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling\ntransactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster\nmore computing power than all the honest participants. I see that he can\ncreate new blocks and add them to create the longest chain, but how can\nhe erase or add old transactions in the chain? As the attacker sends out\nhis new blocks, aren't there consistency checks which honest nodes can\nperform, to make sure that nothing got erased? More explanation of this\nattack would be helpful, in order to judge the gains to an attacker from\nthis, versus simply using his computing power to mint new coins honestly.\n\nAs far as the spending transactions, what checks does the recipient of a\ncoin have to perform? Does she need to go back through the coin's entire\nhistory of transfers, and make sure that every transaction on the list is\nindeed linked into the \"timestamp\" block chain? Or can she just do the\nlatest one? Do the timestamp nodes check transactions, making sure that\nthe previous transaction on a coin is in the chain, thereby enforcing\nthe rule that all transactions in the chain represent valid coins?\n\nSorry about all the questions, but as I said this does seem to be a\nvery promising and original idea, and I am looking forward to seeing\nhow the concept is further developed. It would be helpful to see a more\nprocess oriented description of the idea, with concrete details of the\ndata structures for the various objects (coins, blocks, transactions),\nthe data which is included in messages, and algorithmic descriptions\nof the procedures for handling the various events which would occur in\nthis system. You mentioned that you are working on an implementation,\nbut I think a more formal, text description of the system would be a\nhelpful next step.\n\nHal Finney\n\n[1] http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

If a transaction reaches 90% of nodes, then each time a new block is found, it has a 90% chance of being in it.\n\n\n> Or for example, what if a node is keeping two or more chains around as\n> it waits to see which grows fastest, and a block comes in for chain A\n> which would include a double-spend of a coin that is in chain B?

The transaction in whichever branch ends up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid.  If someone tries to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the others invalid.\n\nReceivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved.  They can still re-spend the coins immediately, but they should wait before taking an action such as shipping goods.  \n\n\n> I also don't understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling\n> transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster\n> more computing power than all the honest participants.

He has to go back and redo the block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he's doing that.  He's rewriting history.  Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.\n\nThis touches on a key point.  Even though everyone present may see the shenanigans going on, there's no way to take advantage of that fact. \n\nIt is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this.  We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.  The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say.  The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what.\n\n\n> As far as the spending transactions, what checks does the recipient of a\n> coin have to perform?

All transactions before that can be discarded.\n\n\n> Do the timestamp nodes check transactions, making sure that\n> the previous transaction on a coin is in the chain, thereby enforcing\n> the rule that all transactions in the chain represent valid coins?\n\nRight, exactly.  When a node receives a block, it checks the signatures of every transaction in it against previous transactions in blocks.  Blocks can only contain transactions that depend on valid transactions in previous blocks or the same block.  Transaction C could depend on transaction B in the same block and B depends on transaction A in an earlier block.\n\n\n> Sorry about all the questions, but as I said this does seem to be a\n> very promising and original idea, and I am looking forward to seeing\n> how the concept is further developed.

I actually did this kind of backwards.  I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.  I think I will be able to release the code sooner than I could write a detailed spec.

Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one to arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working on incorporating it into the next proof-of-work.  In effect, each node votes for its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its proof-of-work effort.\n\nIf the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an even split, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that decides which is valid.\n\nWhen a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated throughout the network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the next block after it.  Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to include it in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.\n\nThe proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from the globally shared view.  Only the majority of the network together has enough CPU power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work.  Any user, upon receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the network has approved.  Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links back in the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

On the other hand, it is a bit harsh if\nthe guy who came second is likely to lose his coin.\n\nFurther, your description of events implies restrictions\non timing and coin generation - that the entire network\ngenerates coins slowly compared to the time required for\nnews of a new coin to flood the network, otherwise the\nchains diverge more and more, and no one ever knows\nwhich chain is the winner.\n\nYou need to make these restrictions explicit, for\nnetwork flood time may well be quite slow.\n\nWhich implies that the new coin rate is slower.\n\nWe want spenders to have certainty that their\ntransaction is valid at the time it takes a spend to\nflood the network, not at the time it takes for branch\nraces to be resolved.\n\nAt any given time, for example at 1 040 689 138 seconds\nwe can look back at the past and say:\n\n At 1 040 688 737 seconds, node 5 was *it*, and\n he incorporated all the coins he had discovered\n into the chain, and all the new transactions he\n knew about on top of the previous link\n\n At 1 040 688 792 seconds, node 2 was *it*, and\n he incorporated all the coins he had discovered\n into the chain, and all the new transactions he\n knew about into the chain on top of node 5's\n link.\n\n At 1 040 688 745 seconds, node 7 was *it*, and\n he incorporated all the coins he had discovered\n into the chain, and all the new transactions he\n knew about into the chain on top of node 2's\n link.\n\nBut no one can know who is *it* right now\n\nSo how does one know when to reveal one's coins?  One\nsolution is that one does not.  One incorporates a hash\nof the coin secret whenever one thinks one might be\n*it*, and after that hash is securely in the chain,\nafter one knows that one was *it* at the time, one can\nthen safely spend the coin that one has found, revealing\nthe secret.\n\nThis solution takes care of the coin revelation problem,\nbut does not solve the spend recording problem.  If one\nnode is ignoring all spends that it does not care about,\nit suffers no adverse consequences.  We need a protocol\nin which your prospects of becoming *it* also depend on\nbeing seen by other nodes as having a reasonably up to\ndate and complete list of spends - which this protocol\nis not, and your protocol is not either.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

It's as simple as this: let the output value from any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value.  Either the client software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side.  The incentive value when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the fees in the block.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

The target time between blocks will probably be 10 minutes.\n\nEvery block includes its creation time.  If the time is off by more than 36 hours, other nodes won't work on it.  If the timespan over the last 6*24*30 blocks is less than 15 days, blocks are being generated too fast and the proof-of-work difficulty doubles.

Paper cheques can bounce up to a week or two later.  Credit card transactions can be contested up to 60 to 180 days later.  Bitcoin transactions can be sufficiently irreversible in an hour or two.\n\n\n> If one node is ignoring all spends that it does not \n> care about, it suffers no adverse consequences.\n\nWith the transaction fee based incentive system I recently posted, nodes would have an incentive to include all the paying transactions they receive.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

We also\nneed everyone to know that everyone knows X, and that\neveryone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows X\n- which, as in the Byzantine Generals problem, is the\nclassic hard problem of distributed data processing.\n\nThis problem becomes harder when X is quite possibly a\nvery large amount of data - agreement on who was the\nowner of every bitgold coin at such and such a time.\n\nAnd then on top of that we need everyone to have a\nmotive to behave in such a fashion that agreement\narises.

We cannot say how the system will behave under\nattack until we know how the system is supposed to\nbehave when not under attack.\n\nIf there are a lot of transactions, it is hard to\nefficiently discover the discrepancies between one\nnode's view and another node's view, and because new\ntransactions are always arriving, no two nodes will ever\nhave the same view, even if all nodes are honest, and\nall reported transactions are correct and true single\nspends.\n\nWe should be able to accomplish a system where two nodes\nare likely to come to agreement as to who owned what\nbitgold coins at some very recent past time, but it is\nnot simple to do so.\n\nIf one node constructs a hash that represents its\nknowledge of who owned what bitgold coins at a\nparticular time, and another node wants to check that\nhash, it is not simple to do it in such a way that\nagreement is likely, and disagreement between honest\nwell behaved nodes is efficiently detected and\nefficiently resolved.\n\nAnd if we had a specification of how agreement is\ngenerated, it is not obvious why the second node has\nincentive to check that hash.\n\nThe system has to work in such a way that nodes can\neasily and cheaply change their opinion about recent\ntransactions, so as to reach consensus, but in order to\nprovide finality and irreversibility, once consensus has\nbeen reached, and then new stuff has be piled on top of\nold consensus, in particular new bitgold has been piled\non top of old consensus, it then becomes extremely\ndifficult to go back and change what was decided.\n\nSaying that is how it works, does not give us a method\nto make it work that way.\n\n > The receiver of a payment must wait an hour or so\n > before believing that it's valid.

Satoshi has suggested that releasing source code may be the\nbest way to clarify the design. As I have tried to work through details on\nmy own, it does appear that the rules become rather complicated and indeed\none needs at least a pseudo-code algorithm to specify the behavior. So\nperhaps writing real code is not a bad way to go. I found that there is\na sourceforge project set up for bitgold, although it does not have any\ncode yet.\n\nIn answer to James' specific question, about what happens when different\nnodes see different sets of transactions, due to imperfect broadcast, here\nis how I understand it. Each node must be prepared to maintain potentially\nseveral \"candidate\" block chains, each of which may eventually turn out\nto become the longest one, the one which wins. Once a given block chain\nbecomes sufficiently longer than a competitor, the shorter one can be\ndeleted. This length differential is a parameter which depends on the\nnode's threat model for how much compute power an attacker can marshall,\nin terms of the fraction of the \"honst\" P2P network's work capacity,\nand is estimated in the paper. The idea is that once a chain gets far\nenough behind the longest one, there is essentially no chance that it\ncan ever catch up.\n\nIn order to resolve the issue James raised, I think it is necessary\nthat nodes keep a separate pending-transaction list associated with\neach candidate chain. This list would include all transactions the node\nhas received (via broadcast by the transactees) but which have not yet\nbeen incorporated into that block chain. At any given time, the node is\nworking to extend the longest block chain, and the block it is working\nto find a hash collision for will include all of the pending transactions\nassociated with that chain.\n\nI think that this way, when a candidate chain is deleted because it\ngot too much shorter than the longest one, transactions in it are\nnot lost, but have continued to be present in the pending-transaction\nlist associated with the longest chain, in those nodes which heard the\noriginal transaction broadcast. (I have also considered whether nodes\nshould add transactions to their pending-transaction list that they\nlearn about through blocks from other nodes, even if those blocks do\nnot end up making their way into the longest block chain; but I'm not\nsure if that is necessary or helpful.)\n\nOnce these rules are clarified, more formal modeling will be helpful in\nunderstanding the behavior of the network given imperfect reliability. For\nexample, if on average a fraction f of P2P nodes receive a given\ntransaction broadcast, then I think one would expect 1/f block-creation\ntimes to elapse before the transaction appears in what is destined to\nbecome the longest chain. One might also ask, given that the P2P network\nbroadcast is itself imperfectly reliable, how many candidate chains\nmust a given node keep track of at one time, on average? Or as James\nraised earlier, if the network broadcast is reliable but depends on a\npotentially slow flooding algorithm, how does that impact performance?\n\n> And then on top of that we need everyone to have a\n> motive to behave in such a fashion that agreement\n> arises.  I cannot see that they have motive when I do\n> not know the behavior to be motivated.\n\nI am somewhat less worried about motivation. I'd be satisfied if the\nsystem can meet the following criteria:\n\n1. No single node operator, or small collection of node operators\nwhich controls only a small fraction of overall network resources,\ncan effectively cheat, if other players are honest.\n\n2. The long tail of node operators is sufficiently large that no small\ncollection of nodes can control more than a small fraction of overall\nresources. (Here, the \"tail\" refers to a ranking based on amount of\nresources controlled by each operator.)\n\n3. The bitcoin system turns out to be socially useful and valuable, so\nthat node operators feel that they are making a beneficial contribution\nto the world by their efforts (similar to the various \"@Home\" compute\nprojects where people volunteer their compute resources for good causes).\n\nIn this case it seems to me that simple altruism can suffice to keep the\nnetwork running properly.\n\n> Distributed databases are *hard* even when all the\n> databases perfectly follow the will of a single owner.\n> Messages get lost, links drop, syncrhonization delays\n> become abnormal, and entire machines go up in flames,\n> and the network as a whole has to take all this in its\n> stride.\n\nA very good point, and a more complete specification is necessary in order\nto understand how the network will respond to imperfections like this. I\nam looking forward to seeing more detail emerge.\n\nOne thing I might mention is that in many ways bitcoin is two independent\nideas: a way of solving the kinds of problems James lists here, of\ncreating a globally consistent but decentralized database; and then using\nit for a system similar to Wei Dai's b-money (which is referenced in the\npaper) but transaction/coin based rather than account based. Solving the\nglobal, massively decentralized database problem is arguably the harder\npart, as James emphasizes. The use of proof-of-work as a tool for this\npurpose is a novel idea well worth further review IMO.\n\nHal Finney\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

I'll try to rephrase it in that context.\n\nA number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.\n\nThey don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree.  It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.\n\nThey use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem.  Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution.  Once one of the generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work in the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.\n\nAfter two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work.  Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.  They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.\n\nThe proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed database and global view problems you've asked about are solved.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

When a new block arrives for the best branch, ConnectBlock removes the block's transactions from the pending-tx pool.  If a different branch becomes longer, it calls DisconnectBlock on the main branch down to the fork, returning the block transactions to the pending-tx pool, and calls ConnectBlock on the new branch, sopping back up any transactions that were in both branches.  It's expected that reorgs like this would be rare and shallow.\n\nWith this optimisation, candidate branches are not really any burden.  They just sit on the disk and don't require attention unless they ever become the main chain.\n\n\n> Or as James raised earlier, if the network broadcast \n> is reliable but depends on a potentially slow flooding \n> algorithm, how does that impact performance?\n\nBroadcasts will probably be almost completely reliable.  TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days, and the broadcast protocol has a retry mechanism to get the data from other nodes after a while.  If broadcasts turn out to be slower in practice than expected, the target time between blocks may have to be increased to avoid wasting resources.  We want blocks to usually propagate in much less time than it takes to generate them, otherwise nodes would spend too much time working on obsolete blocks.\n\nI'm planning to run an automated test with computers randomly sending payments to each other and randomly dropping packets.\n\n\n> 3.

    "text": "Okay.... I'm going to summarize this protocol as I understand it. \n\nI'm filling in some operational details that aren't in the paper \nby supplementing what you wrote with what my own \"design sense\" \ntells me are critical missing bits or \"obvious\" methodologies for \nuse.\n\nFirst, people spend computer power creating a pool of coins to use \nas money.  Each coin is a proof-of-work meeting whatever criteria \nwere in effect for money at the time it was created.  The time of \ncreation (and therefore the criteria) is checkable later because \npeople can see the emergence of this particular coin in the \ntransaction chain and track it through all its \"consensus view\" \nspends.  (more later on coin creation tied to adding a link). \n\nWhen a coin is spent, the buyer and seller digitally sign a (blinded) \ntransaction record, and broadcast it to a bunch of nodes whose purpose \nis keeping track of consensus regarding coin ownership.  If someone \ndouble spends, then the transaction record can be unblinded revealing \nthe identity of the cheater.  This is done via a fairly standard cut-\nand-choose algorithm where the buyer responds to several challenges \nwith secret shares, and the seller then asks him to \"unblind\" and \nchecks all but one, verifying that they do contain secret shares any \ntwo of which are sufficient to identify the buyer.  In this case the \nseller accepts the unblinded spend record as \"probably\" containing \na valid secret share. \n\nThe nodes keeping track of consensus regarding coin ownership are in \na loop where they are all trying to \"add a link\" to the longest chain \nthey've so far recieved.  They have a pool of reported transactions \nwhich they've not yet seen in a \"consensus\" signed chain.  I'm going \nto call this pool \"A\".  They attempt to add a link to the chain by\nmoving everything from pool A into a pool \"L\" and using a CPU-\nintensive digital signature algorithm to sign the chain including \nthe new block L.  This results in a chain extended by a block \ncontaining all the transaction records they had in pool L, plus \nthe node's digital signature.  While they do this, new \ntransaction records continue to arrive and go into pool A again \nfor the next cycle of work. \n\nThey may also recieve chains as long as the one they're trying to \nextend while they work, in which the last few \"links\" are links \nthat are *not* in common with the chain on which they're working.\nThese they ignore.  (?  Do they ignore them?  Under what \ncircumstances would these become necessary to ever look at again, \nbearing in mind that any longer chain based on them will include \nthem?) \n\nBut if they recieve a _longer_ chain while working, they \nimmediately check all the transactions in the new links to make \nsure it contains no double spends and that the \"work factors\" of \nall new links are appropriate.  If it contains a double spend, \nthen they create a \"transaction\" which is a proof of double \nspending, add it to their pool A, broadcast it, and continue work.  \nIf one of the \"new\" links has an inappropriate work factor (ie, \nsomeone didn't put enough CPU into it for it to be \"licit\" \naccording to the rules) a new \"transaction\" which is a proof \nof the protocol violation by the link-creating node is created, \nbroadcast, and added to pool A, and the chain is rejected.  In \nthe case of no double spends and appropriate work factors for \nall links not yet seen, they accept the new chain as consensus. \n\nIf the new chain is accepted, then they give up on adding their\ncurrent link, dump all the transactions from pool L back into pool \nA (along with transactions they've recieved or created since \nstarting work), eliminate from pool A those transaction records \nwhich are already part of a link in the new chain, and start work \nagain trying to extend the new chain. \n\nIf they complete work on a chain extended with their new link, they \nbroadcast it and immediately start work on another new link with \nall the transactions that have accumulated in pool A since they \nbegan work.  \n\nDo I understand it correctly?\n\n\n\n\nBiggest Technical Problem: \n\nIs there a mechanism to make sure that the \"chain\" does not consist \nsolely of links added by just the 3 or 4 fastest nodes?  'Cause a \nbroadcast transaction record could easily miss those 3 or 4 nodes \nand if it does, and those nodes continue to dominate the chain, the \ntransaction might never get added.  \n\nTo remedy this, you need to either ensure provable propagation of\ntransactions, or vary the work factor for a node depending on how \nmany links have been added since that node's most recent link.   \n\nUnfortunately, both measures can be defeated by sock puppets.  \nThis is probably the worst problem with your protocol as it \nstands right now; you need some central point to control the \nidentities (keys) of the nodes and prevent people from making \nnew sock puppets. \n\nProvable propagation would mean that When Bob accepts a new chain \nfrom Alice, he needs to make sure that Alice has (or gets) all\ntransactions in his \"A\" and \"L\" pools.  He sends them, and \nAlice sends back a signed hash to prove she got them. Once \nAlice has recieved this block of transactions, if any subsequent \nchains including a link added by Alice do not include those \ntransactions at or before that link, then Bob should be able to \npublish the block he sent Alice, along with her signature, in a\ntransaction as proof that Alice violated protocol.  Sock puppets \ndefeat this because Alice just signs subsequent chains using a \nnew key, pretending to be a different node. \n\nIf we go with varying the work factor depending on how many new \nlinks there are,  then we're right back to domination by the 3 \nor 4 fastest nodes, except now they're joined by 600 or so \nsock puppets which they use to avoid the work factor penalty. \n\nIf we solve the sock-puppet issue, or accept that there's a central \npoint controlling the generation of new keys, then generation of \ncoins should be tied to the act of successfully adding a block to \nthe \"consensus\" chain.  This is simple to do; creation of a coin \nis a transaction, it gets added along with all the other transactions \nin the block.  But you can only create one coin per link, and of \ncourse if your version of the chain isn't the one that gets accepted,\nthen in the \"accepted\" view you don't have the coin and can't spend \nit.  This gives the people maintaining the consensus database a \nreason to spend CPU cycles, especially since the variance in work \nfactor by number of links added since their own last link (outlined\nabove) guarantees that everyone, not just the 3 or 4 fastest nodes,\noccasionally gets the opportunity to create a coin.\n\nAlso, the work requirement for adding a link to the chain should \nvary (again exponentially) with the number of links added to that \nchain in the previous week, causing the rate of coin generation \n(and therefore inflation) to be strictly controlled.  \n\nYou need coin aggregation for this to scale.  There needs to be \na \"provable\" transaction where someone retires ten single coins \nand creates a new coin with denomination ten, etc.  This is not \ntoo hard, using the same infrastructure you've already got; it \nsimply becomes part of the chain, and when the chain is accepted\nconsensus, then everybody can see that it happened. \n\n\n\n    Bear\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

If the same chain contains both spends, then the block is invalid and rejected.  \n\nSame if a block didn't have enough proof-of-work.  That block is invalid and rejected.  There's no need to circulate a report about it.  Every node could see that and reject it before relaying it.\n\nIf there are two competing chains, each containing a different version of the same transaction, with one trying to give money to one person and the other trying to give the same money to someone else, resolving which of the spends is valid is what the whole proof-of-work chain is about.\n\nWe're not \"on the lookout\" for double spends to sound the alarm and catch the cheater.  We merely adjudicate which one of the spends is valid.  Receivers of transactions must wait a few blocks to make sure that resolution has had time to complete.  Would be cheaters can try and simultaneously double-spend all they want, and all they accomplish is that within a few blocks, one of the spends becomes valid and the others become invalid.  Any later double-spends are immediately rejected once there's already a spend in the main chain.  \n\nEven if an earlier spend wasn't in the chain yet, if it was already in all the nodes' pools, then the second spend would be turned away by all those nodes that already have the first spend.\n\n\n> If the new chain is accepted, then they give up on adding their\n> current link, dump all the transactions from pool L back into pool\n> A (along with transactions they've received or created since\n> starting work), eliminate from pool A those transaction records\n> which are already part of a link in the new chain, and start work\n> again trying to extend the new chain.\n\nRight.

It's all prevention.\n\nOkay, that's surprising.  If you're not using buyer/seller \nidentities, then you are not checking that a spend is being made \nby someone who actually is the owner of (on record as having \nrecieved) the coin being spent.  \n\nThere are three categories of identity that are useful to \nthink about.  Category one: public.  Real-world identities \nare a matter of record and attached to every transaction.  \nCategory two: Pseudonymous.  There are persistent \"identities\" \nwithin the system and people can see if something was done by \nthe same nym that did something else, but there's not necessarily \nany way of linking the nyms with real-world identities.  Category \nthree: unlinkably anonymous.  There is no concept of identity,\npersistent or otherwise.  No one can say or prove whether the \nagents involved in any transaction are the same agents as involved \nin any other transaction. \n\nAre you claiming category 3 as you seem to be, or category 2?\nLots of people don't distinguish between anonymous and \npseudonymous protocols, so it's worth asking exactly what \nyou mean here.  \n\nAnyway:  I'll proceed on the assumption that you meant very \nnearly (as nearly as I can imagine, anyway) what you said, \nunlinkably anonymous.  That means that instead of an \"identity\", \na spender has to demonstrate knowledge of a secret known only \nto the real owner of the coin.  One way to do this would be \nto have the person recieving the coin generate an asymmetric \nkey pair, and then have half of it published with the \ntransaction.  In order to spend the coin later, s/he must \ndemonstrate posession of the other half of the asymmetric \nkey pair, probably by using it to sign the key provided by \nthe new seller.  So we cannot prove anything about \"identity\", \nbut we can prove that the spender of the coin is someone who \nknows a secret that the person who recieved the coin knows. \n\nAnd what you say next seems to confirm this: \n\n> No challenges or secret shares.  A basic transaction is just \n> what you see in the figure in section 2.  A signature (of the \n> buyer) satisfying the public key of the previous transaction, \n> and a new public key (of the seller) that must be satisfied to \n> spend it the next time.\n\n\nNote, even though this doesn't involve identity per se, it still \nmakes the agent doing the spend linkable to the agent who \nearlier recieved the coin, so these transactions are linkable.  \nIn order to counteract this, the owner of the coin needs to \nmake a transaction, indistinguishable to others from any \nnormal transaction, in which he creates a new key pair and \ntransfers the coin to its posessor (ie, has one sock puppet \n\"spend\" it to another). No change in real-world identity of \nthe owner, but the transaction \"linkable\" to the agent who spent \nthe coin is unlinked.  For category-three unlinkability, this \nhas to be done a random number of times - maybe one to six \ntimes?  \n\n\nBTW, could you please learn to use carriage returns??  Your \nlines are scrolling stupidly off to the right and I have to \nscroll to see what the heck you're saying, then edit to add \ncarriage returns before I respond. \n\n\n> > If it contains a double spend, then they create a \"transaction\" \n> > which is a proof of double spending, add it to their pool A, \n> > broadcast it, and continue work.\n\n> There's no need for reporting of \"proof of double spending\" like \n> that.

The merchants are left holding the bag with \n\"invalid\" coins, unless they wait that magical \"few blocks\" \n(and how can they know how many?) before treating the spender \nas having paid.  \n\nThe consumers won't do this if they spend their coin and it takes \nan hour to clear before they can do what they spent their coin on. \nThe merchants won't do it if there's no way to charge back a \ncustomer when they find the that their coin is invalid because \nthe customer has doublespent.\n\n> Even if an earlier spend wasn't in the chain yet, if it was \n> already in all the nodes' pools, then the second spend would \n> be turned away by all those nodes that already have the first \n> spend.\n\nSo there's a possibility of an early catch when the broadcasts of \nthe initial simultaneous spends interfere with each other.  I assume \nhere that the broadcasts are done by the sellers, since the buyer \nhas a possible disincentive to broadly disseminate spends. \n\n> > If the new chain is accepted, then they give up on adding their\n> > current link ... and start work again trying to extend the new \n> > chain.\n> \n> Right.

You \ncan change the data set while working, and it doesn't mean you \nneed to start over. This is good in this case, as it means nobody \nhas to hold recently recieved transactions out of the link they're\nworking on.\n\n> > Is there a mechanism to make sure that the \"chain\" does not consist\n> > solely of links added by just the 3 or 4 fastest nodes? \n\n> If you're thinking of it as a CPU-intensive digital signing, then \n> you may be thinking of a race to finish a long operation first and \n> the fastest always winning.\n\nRight.  That was the misconception I was working with.  Again, the \ndifference between a proof taking a huge set number of CPU cycles \nand a proof that takes a tiny number of CPU cycles but has a tiny \nchance of success.\n\n> Anyone's chance of finding a solution at any \n> time is proportional to their CPU power.\n\nIt's like a random variation in the work factor; in this way it works \nin your favor. \n\n> There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive \n> to receive and include all the transactions they can.

But the economic effect is the same (albeit somewhat \nrandomized) if adding a link to the chain allows the node to create \na coin, so I would stick with that.\n\nAlso, be aware that the compute power of different nodes can be \nexpected to vary by two orders of magnitude at any given moment in \nhistory. \n\n    Bear\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

A new key pair is used for every\ntransaction.\n\nIt's not pseudonymous in the sense of nyms identifying people, but it\nis at least a little pseudonymous in that the next action on a coin\ncan be identified as being from the owner of that coin.\n\n\n> Mmmm.

As you've said, it's\nfutile and can be trivially defeated with sock puppets.\n\nThe credential that establishes someone as real is the ability to\nsupply CPU power. \n\n\n> Until.... until what?

If you're selling something that\ndoesn't merit a network-scale attack to steal it, in practice you\ncould cut it closer.\n\n\n> But in the absence of identity, there's no downside to them\n> if spends become invalid, if they've already received the\n> goods they double-spent for (access to website, download,\n> whatever).

Think 6\ndegrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially.  It would only take\nsomething like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough\nthat a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing\nvery many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.\n During those 2 minutes, the merchant's nodes can be watching for a\ndouble-spent transaction.  The double-spender would not be able to\nblast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant\ngetting it, so he has to wait before starting.\n\nIf the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches\n10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90%\nchance his money gets spent.  For almost any type of goods, that's\nnot going to be worth it for the scammer.\n\nInformation based goods like access to website or downloads are\nnon-fencible.  Nobody is going to be able to make a living off\nstealing access to websites or downloads.  They can go to the file\nsharing networks to steal that.  Most instant-access products aren't\ngoing to have a huge incentive to steal. \n\nIf a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the\ncustomer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many\nalready do.  If they really want to optimize, and it's a large\ndownload, they could cancel the download in the middle if the\ntransaction comes back double-spent.  If it's website access,\ntypically it wouldn't be a big deal to let the customer have access\nfor 5 minutes and then cut off access if it's rejected.  Many such\nsites have a free trial anyway.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

However, when one is talking of\ndistributed data, time is always of consequence, because\nit is all about synchronization (that peers need to have\ncorresponding views at corresponding times) so when one\ndoes distributed data processing, broadcasts are always\nhighly unreliable Attempts to ensure that each\nmessage arrives at least once result in increased timing\nvariation. Thus one has to make a protocol that is\neither UDP or somewhat UDP like, in that messages are\nsmall, failure of messages to arrive is common, messages\ncan arrive in different order to the order in which they\nwere sent, and the same message may arrive multiple\ntimes.  Either we have UDP, or we need to accommodate\nthe same problems as UDP has on top of TCP connections.\n\nRather than assuming that each message arrives at least\nonce, we have to make a mechanism such that the\ninformation arrives even though conveyed by messages\nthat frequently fail to arrive.\n\n > TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days\n\nPeople always load connections near maximum.  When a\nconnection is near maximum, TCP connections suffer\nfrequent unreasonably long delays, and connections\nsimply fail a lot - your favorite web cartoon somehow\nshows it is loading forever, and you try again, or it\ncomes up with a little x in place of a picture, and you\ntry again\n\nFurther very long connections - for example ftp\ndownloads of huge files,  seldom complete. If you try to\nftp a movie, you are unlikely to get anywhere unless\nboth client and server have a resume mechanism so that\nthey can talk about partially downloaded files.\n\nUDP connections, for example Skype video calls, also\nsuffer frequent picture freezes, loss of quality, and so\nforth, and have to have mechanisms to keep going\nregardless.\n\n > It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if\n > we can explain it properly.

You have an outline\nand proposal for such a design, which is a big step\nforward, but the devil is in the little details.\n\nI really should provide a fleshed out version of your\nproposal, rather than nagging you to fill out the blind\nspots.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

I have been working on my own\nversion based on Patricia hash trees, (not yet ready to\npost, will post in a week or so) with the consensus\ngeneration being a generalization of file sharing using\nMerkle hash trees. Patricia hash trees where the high\norder part of the Patricia key represents the high order\npart of the time can be used to share data that evolves\nin time.  The algorithm, if implemented by honest\ncorrectly functioning peers, regularly generates\nconsensus hashes of the recent past - thereby addressing\nthe problem I have been complaining about - that we have\na mechanism to protect against consensus distortion by\ndishonest or malfunctioning peers, which is useless\nabsent a definition of consensus generation by honest\nand correctly functioning peers.\n\n > First, people spend computer power creating a pool of\n > coins to use as money.

I don't think\nblinding can be made to work.  We can blind the\ntransaction details easily enough, by only making hashes\nof the details public, (X paid Y for\n49vR7xmwYcKXt9zwPJ943h9bHKC2pG68m) but that X paid Y is\ngoing to be fairly obvious.\n\nIf when Joe spends a coin to me, then I have to have the\nability to ask \"Does Joe rightfully own this coin\", then\nit is difficult to see how this can be implemented in a\ndistributed protocol without giving people the ability\nto trawl through data detecting that Joe paid me.\n\nTo maintain a consensus on who owns what coins, who owns\nwhat coins has to be public.\n\nWe can build a privacy layer on top of this - account\nmoney and chaumian money based on bitgold coins, much as\nthe pre 1915 US banking system layered account money and\nbank notes on top of gold coins, and indeed we have to\nbuild a layer on top to bring the transaction cost down\nto the level that supports agents performing micro\ntransactions, as needed for bandwidth control, file\nsharing, and charging non white listed people to send us\ncommunications.\n\nSo the entities on the public record are entities\nfunctioning like pre 1915 banks - let us call them\nbinks, for post 1934 banks no longer function like that.\n\n > But if they recieve a _longer_ chain while working,\n > they immediately check all the transactions in the new\n > links to make sure it contains no double spends and\n > that the \"work factors\" of all new links are\n > appropriate.\n\nI am troubled that this involves frequent\nretransmissions of data that is already mostly known.\nConsensus and widely distributed beliefs about bitgold\nownership already involves significant cost.  Further,\neach transmission of data is subject to data loss, which\ncan result in thrashing, with the risk that the\ngeneration of consensus may slow below the rate of new\ntransactions.  We already have problems getting the cost\ndown to levels that support micro transactions by\nsoftware agents, which is the big unserved market -\nbandwidth control, file sharing, and charging non white\nlisted people to send us communications.\n\nTo work as useful project, has to be as efficient as it\ncan be - hence my plan to use a Patricia hash tree\nbecause it identifies and locate small discrepancies\nbetween peers that are mostly in agreement already,\nwithout them needing to transmit their complete data.\n\nWe also want to avoid very long hash chains that have to\nbe frequently checked in order to validate things.  Any\ntime a hash chain can potentially become enormously long\nover time, we need to ensure that no one ever has to\nrewalk the full length.

Designing the\nsystem on this basis considerably reduces processing\ncosts.\n\nRecall that SET died on its ass in large part because\nevery transaction involved innumerable public key\noperations.  Similarly, we have huge security flaws in\nhttps because it has so many redundant public key\noperations that web site designers try to minimize the\nuse of https to cover only those areas that truly need\nit - and they always get the decision as to what truly\nneeds it subtly wrong.\n\nEfficiency is critical, particularly as the part of the\nmarket not yet served is the market for very low cost\ntransactions.\n\n > If we solve the sock-puppet issue, or accept that\n > there's a central point controlling the generation of\n > new keys,\n\nA central point will invite attack, will be attacked.\n\nThe problem with computer networked money is that the\npast can so easily be revised, so nodes come under\npressure to adjust the past - \"I did not pay that\"\nswiftly becomes \"I should not have paid that\", which\nrequires arbitration, which is costly, and introduces\nuncertainty, which is costly, and invites government\nregulation, which is apt to be utterly ruinous and\nwholly devastating.\n\nFor many purposes, reversal and arbitration is highly\ndesirable, but there is no way anyone can compete with\nthe arbitration provided by Visa and Mastercard, for\nthey have network effects on their side, and they do a\nreally good job of arbitration, at which they have vast\nexperience, accumulated skills, wisdom, and good repute.\nSo any new networked transaction system has to target\nthe demand for final and irreversible transactions.\n\nThe idea of a distributed network consensus is that one\nhas a lot of peers in a lot of jurisdictions, and once a\ntransaction has entered into the consensus, undoing it\nis damn near impossible - one would have to pressure\nmost of the peers in most of the jurisdictions to agree,\nand many of them don't even talk your language, and\nthose that do, will probably pretend that they do not.\nSo people will not even try.\n\nTo avoid pressure, the network has to avoid any central\npoint at which pressure can be applied.  Recall Nero's\nwish that Rome had a single throat that he could cut. If\nwe provide them with such a throat, it will be cut.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

With\n20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.\n\nSo the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute\ntime may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million\nto 1!

Bitcoin has a couple\nof things going for it: one is that it is distributed, with no single\npoint of failure, no \"mint\", no company with officers that can be\nsubpoenaed and arrested and shut down. It is more like a P2P network,\nand as we have seen, despite degrees of at least governmental distaste,\nthose are still around.\n\nBitcoin could also conceivably operate in a less anonymous mode, with\ntransfers being linked to individuals, rather than single-use keys. It\nwould still be useful to have a large scale, decentralized electronic\npayment system.\n\nIt also might be possible to refactor and restructure Bitcoin to separate\nout the key new idea, a decentralized, global, irreversible transaction\ndatabase. Such a functionality might be useful for other purposes. Once\nit exists, using it to record monetary transfers would be a sort of side\neffect and might be harder to shut down.\n\n> I also worry about other \"domestic\" ways nasty people could exploit\n> a widespread Bitcoin deployment:\n> * Spammer botnets could burn through pay-per-send email filters\n>   trivially (as usual, the costs would fall on people other than the\n>   botnet herders & spammers).\n> * If each machine in a botnet sends 1 cent to a herder, that can add\n>   up to a significant amount of money.  In other words, Bitcoin would\n>   make botnet herding and the assorted malware industry even more\n>   profitable than it already is.\n\nIt's important to understand that the proof-of-work (POW) aspect of\nBitcoin is primarily oriented around ensuring the soundness of the\nhistorical transaction database. Each Bitcoin data block records a set\nof transactions, and includes a hash collision. Subsequent data blocks\nhave their own transactions, their own collisions, and also chain to\nall earlier hashes.  The result is that once a block is \"buried\" under\nenough new blocks, it is essentially certain (given the threat model,\nnamely that attackers cannot muster more than X% of the compute power\nof legitimate node operators) that old transactions can't be reversed.\n\nCreating new coins is indeed currently also being done by POW, but I\nthink that is seen as a temporary expedient, and in fact the current\nsoftware phases that out over several years. Hence worries about botnets\nbeing able to manufacture large quantities of POW tokens are only a\ntemporary concern, in the context of Bitcoin.\n\nThere have been a number of discussions in the past about POW tokens as\nanti spam measures, given the botnet threat. References are available from\n\"Proof-of-work system\" on Wikipedia. Analyses have yielded mixed results,\ndepending on the assumptions and system design.\n\nIf POW tokens do become useful, and especially if they become money,\nmachines will no longer sit idle. Users will expect their computers to\nbe earning them money (assuming the reward is greater than the cost to\noperate). A computer whose earnings are being stolen by a botnet will\nbe more noticeable to its owner than is the case today, hence we might\nexpect that in that world, users will work harder to maintain their\ncomputers and clean them of botnet infestations.\n\nCountermeasures by botnet operators would include moderating their take,\nperhaps only stealing 10% of the productive capacity of invaded computers,\nso that their owners would be unlikely to notice. This kind of thinking\nquickly degenerates into unreliable speculation, but it points out the\ndifficulties of analyzing the full ramifications of a world where POW\ntokens are valuble.\n\nHal Finney\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with\nautomated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the\nmessage.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become\ntoo high for spam to be cost effective. \n\nThe process has the potential to establish the POW token's value\nin the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could\nbuy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would\ntemporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the\nself-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the\nspammers.\n\nInterestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of\nspam called \"dusting\".  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust\nin order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.\n If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're\nwilling to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a\nmessage with it, users could set how much they're willing to get\npaid to receive spam.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\n\n",

Then the\ntotal value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all\nthe wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household\nwealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With\n20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.\n\nSo the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute\ntime may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million\nto 1!

It's completely decentralized\nwith no server or central authority.\n \nYou can find screenshots and the download link at:\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\n \nWindows only for now.  Open source C++ code is included.\n\n- Unpack the files into a directory\n- Run BITCOIN.EXE\n- It automatically connects to other nodes\n\nIf you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,\nyou'll really be helping the network a lot.  Port 8333 on your\nfirewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.\n\nThe software is still alpha and experimental.  There's no guarantee\nthe system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it\nbecomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in\nextensibility and versioning.\n\nYou can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on\nOptions->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks.  I made\nthe proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so\nfor a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to\ngenerate coins in just a few hours.  It'll get a lot harder when\ncompetition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.\nGenerated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be\nspent.\n\nThere are two ways to send money.  If the recipient is online, you\ncan enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public\nkey and send the transaction with comments.  If the recipient is\nnot online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which\nis a hash of their public key that they give you.  They'll receive\nthe transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's\nin.  This method has the disadvantage that no comment information\nis sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used\nmultiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't\nbe online at the same time or the recipient can't receive incoming\nconnections.\n\nTotal circulation will be 21,000,000 coins.

They'll each connect over the\nInternet, while incoming connections only come to the host that\nport 8333 is routed to. \n\nAs an optimisation, I'll make a switch \"-connect=1.2.3.4\" to make\nit only connect to a specific address.

It doesn't really matter for now, since the network\nwould have to get huge before the bandwidth is anything more than\ntrivial.\n\n\n> BTW I don't remember if we talked about this, but the other day some\n> people were mentioning secure timestamping.

A few lines of code could create a transaction with\nan extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.  \nI should add a command to timestamp a file that way.\n\n\n> > > Later I want to add interfaces to make it really easy to integrate\n> > > into websites from any server side language.\n>\n> Right, and I'd like to see more of a library interface that could be\n> called from programming or scripting languages, on the client side as\n> well.\n \nExactly.\n\n \nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\n\n\n\n",

It's just status messages that help with debugging.\n\nbitcoin.sourceforge.net looks fine now.  Maybe sourceforge was doing \nsome maintenance.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\n",

For details on how it works, see  \n</i>&gt;<i> the design paper at <a href=\"http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\">http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a>\n</i>&gt;<i>\n</i>&gt;<i> The result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.  \n</i>&gt;<i> Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly  \n</i>&gt;<i> with each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for  \n</i>&gt;<i> double-spending.\n</i>&gt;<i>\n</i>&gt;<i> Satoshi Nakamoto\n</i>&gt;<i> <a href=\"http://www.bitcoin.org/\">http://www.bitcoin.org</a>\n</i>&gt;<i>\n</i>&gt;<i> _______________________________________________\n</i>&gt;<i> p2presearch mailing list\n</i>&gt;<i> <a href=\"http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org\">p2presearch at listcultures.org</a>\n</i>&gt;<i> <a href=\"http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org\">http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org</a>\n</i>\n\n",

    "text": "Announcing the release of Bitcoin, a new open source peer-to-peer \nelectronic cash system that's completely decentralized, with no central \nserver or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own \nmoney and transact directly with each other, with the help of the P2P \nnetwork to check for double-spending.\n\nWindows NT/2000/XP/Vista.  Open source C++ code is included.\n\nDownload: <a href=\"http://www.bitcoin.org/\">http://www.bitcoin.org</a>\n\n- Unpack the files into a directory\n- Run BITCOIN.EXE\n- It automatically connects to other nodes\n\nIf you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections, you'll \nreally be helping the network a lot.  Port 8333 on your firewall needs \nto be open to receive incoming connections.\n\nYou can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on \nOptions-&gt;Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks.  I made the \nproof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so for a \nlittle while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to generate \ncoins in just a few hours.  It'll get a lot harder when competition \nmakes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.  Generated coins \nmust wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be spent.\n\nThere are two ways to send money.  If the recipient is online, you can \nenter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public key and \nsend the transaction with comments.  If the recipient is not online, it \nis possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which is a hash of their \npublic key that they give you.  They'll receive the transaction the next \ntime they connect and get the block it's in.  This method has the \ndisadvantage that no comment information is sent, and a bit of privacy \nmay be lost if the address is used multiple times, but it is a useful \nalternative if both users can't be online at the same time or the \nrecipient can't receive incoming connections.\n\nTotal circulation will be 21,000,000 coins.  It'll be distributed to \nnetwork nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 \nyears.\n\nfirst 4 years: 10,500,000 coins\nnext 4 years: 5,250,000 coins\nnext 4 years: 2,625,000 coins\nnext 4 years: 1,312,500 coins\netc...\n\nWhen that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if needed. \nIt's based on open market competition, and there will probably always be \nnodes willing to process transactions for free.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bitcoin.org/\">http://www.bitcoin.org</a>\n\n",
