  excerpt: What [bitcoins] lack is their own fundamental intrinsic value. You can’t
    do anything with a bitcoin, other than trade it for something you want. So, intrinsically,
    the bitcoin itself has no value. It only has value as a medium of exchange so
    long as people are willing to accept it.

  excerpt: I think there are two realistic directions the bitcoin ecosystem could
    go in. First, it could just implode and disappear if governments decide that virtual
    currencies cause too much harm and are too hard to regulate. Long-term investments
    in bitcoin would then go up in smoke. Second, it could continue as a virtual currency
    that is only used on the dark web with exchanges that are run by people willing
    to break the laws. The value of bitcoin would decline to whatever the illegal
    sector could support; regular investors wouldn’t be able to get their value from
    bitcoin unless they cashed it in with someone who wanted to do bad things.

    They will not use it in exchange. Companies will not sell goods and services based

  article: Bitcoin passes $1,000 but only number that matters is zero
  date: January 3, 2017
  source: Financial Times
  excerpt: 'As a phenomenon bitcoin has all the attributes of a pyramid scheme, requiring
    a constant influx of converts to push up the price, based on the promise of its
    use by future converts. So the ultimate value for bitcoin will be the same as
    all pyramid schemes: zero.'

  article: Bitcoin Is Mania, Not a Store of Value… I Sold-Out Last Week
  date: June 2, 2017
  source: Mauldin Economics
  excerpt: Bitcoin was supposed to be a store of value, you couldn’t mess with the
    formula… and now they are talking about a ‘hard fork’ changing it? Even if they
    don’t change the formula, the fact that they could? That’s enough to say it’s
    not a long-term store of value.

  article: Billionaire investor Marks, who called the dotcom bubble, says bitcoin
    is a 'pyramid scheme'
  date: July 26, 2017
  source: CNBC
  excerpt: In my view, digital currencies are nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps
    even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that
    has little or none beyond what people will pay for it.
