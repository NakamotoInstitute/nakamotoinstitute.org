They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with\nautomated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the\nmessage.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become\ntoo high for spam to be cost effective. \n\nThe process has the potential to establish the POW token's value\nin the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could\nbuy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would\ntemporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the\nself-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the\nspammers.\n\nInterestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of\nspam called \"dusting\".  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust\nin order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.\n If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're\nwilling to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a\nmessage with it, users could set how much they're willing to get\npaid to receive spam.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majord...@metzdowd.com\n\n\n"

Think 6\ndegrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially.  It would only take\nsomething like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough\nthat a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing\nvery many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.\n During those 2 minutes, the merchant's nodes can be watching for a\ndouble-spent transaction.  The double-spender would not be able to\nblast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant\ngetting it, so he has to wait before starting.\n\nIf the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches\n10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90%\nchance his money gets spent.  For almost any type of goods, that's\nnot going to be worth it for the scammer.\n\nInformation based goods like access to website or downloads are\nnon-fencible.  Nobody is going to be able to make a living off\nstealing access to websites or downloads.  They can go to the file\nsharing networks to steal that.  Most instant-access products aren't\ngoing to have a huge incentive to steal. \n\nIf a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the\ncustomer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many\nalready do.  If they really want to optimize, and it's a large\ndownload, they could cancel the download in the middle if the\ntransaction comes back double-spent.  If it's website access,\ntypically it wouldn't be a big deal to let the customer have access\nfor 5 minutes and then cut off access if it's rejected.  Many such\nsites have a free trial anyway.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to [EMAIL PROTECTED]\n\n\n"

I'll \ntry to rephrase it in that context.\n\nA number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the \nKing's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain \nnumber of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a \npacket, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and \nerase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  They \nonly have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack \nat the same time.\n\nThey don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree. \n It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and \nwhatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is \nthat the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different \nattack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear \nthe other first.\n\nThey use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem.  Once each general \nreceives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an \nextremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its \nhash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of \nthem all working at once before one of them finds a solution.  Once one of the \ngenerals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone \nchanges their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work \nin the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack \ntime, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.\n\nAfter two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 \nproofs-of-work.  Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the \nproof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was \nexpended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers \nto produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.  They had to all have \nseen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU \npower exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, \nthey can safely attack at the agreed time.\n\nThe proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed database \nand global view problems you've asked about are solved.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to [EMAIL PROTECTED]\n\n\n"

In effect, each node votes for \nits viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its \nproof-of-work effort.\n\nIf the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an even \nsplit, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that \ndecides which is valid.\n\nWhen a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated throughout the \nnetwork and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the next block \nafter it.  Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to include \nit in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.\n\nThe proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from the \nglobally shared view.  Only the majority of the network together has enough CPU \npower to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work.  Any user, upon \nreceiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the network has \napproved.  Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links back in \nthe chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to [EMAIL PROTECTED]\n\n\n"

If a transaction reaches 90% of nodes, then each time a new block is \nfound, it has a 90% chance of being in it.\n\n\n> Or for example, what if a node is keeping two or more chains around as\n> it waits to see which grows fastest, and a block comes in for chain A\n> which would include a double-spend of a coin that is in chain B?

The transaction in whichever branch ends \nup getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid.  If someone tries \nto double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the \nothers invalid.\n\nReceivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps \nan hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved.  \nThey can still re-spend the coins immediately, but they should wait before \ntaking an action such as shipping goods.  \n\n\n> I also don't understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling\n> transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster\n> more computing power than all the honest participants.

He has to go back and redo the \nblock his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new \nblocks the network keeps adding to the end while he's doing that.  He's \nrewriting history.  Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.\n\nThis touches on a key point.  Even though everyone present may see the \nshenanigans going on, there's no way to take advantage of that fact. \n\nIt is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid \none.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and \ngot replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those \nwho were not present of this.  We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to \none branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and \nothers that joined later and never saw what happened.  The CPU power \nproof-of-work vote must have the final say.  The only way for everyone to stay \non the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, \nno matter what.\n\n\n> As far as the spending transactions, what checks does the recipient of a\n> coin have to perform?

All transactions before that can be discarded.\n\n\n> Do the timestamp nodes check transactions, making sure that\n> the previous transaction on a coin is in the chain, thereby enforcing\n> the rule that all transactions in the chain represent valid coins?\n\nRight, exactly.  When a node receives a block, it checks the signatures of \nevery transaction in it against previous transactions in blocks.  Blocks can \nonly contain transactions that depend on valid transactions in previous blocks \nor the same block.  Transaction C could depend on transaction B in the same \nblock and B depends on transaction A in an earlier block.\n\n\n> Sorry about all the questions, but as I said this does seem to be a\n> very promising and original idea, and I am looking forward to seeing\n> how the concept is further developed.

I actually did this kind of backwards.  I had to \nwrite all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every \nproblem, then I wrote the paper.  I think I will be able to release the code \nsooner than I could write a detailed spec.

The requirement \nis that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single \nattacker. \n\nThere would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overpower \nthe network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.  The \nsmaller farms are then the \"honest nodes\".  (I need a better term than \n\"honest\")  The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the \nbar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to \noverpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.  According to the \n\"long tail\" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together \nshould add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.\n\nEven if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's instantly \nrich.  All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like \nbouncing a check.  To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a \nmerchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his \nmoney back.  I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding \nscheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins.  With a zombie farm that \nbig, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.\n\nThe Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to \ngenerating bitcoins instead.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to [EMAIL PROTECTED]\n\n\n"
